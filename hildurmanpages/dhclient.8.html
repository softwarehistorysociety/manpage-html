<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Internet
Systems Consortium DHCP Client, <b>dhclient</b>, provides a
means for configuring one or more network interfaces using
the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, BOOTP protocol, or
if these protocols fail, by statically assigning an
address.</p>

<h2>OPERATION
<a name="OPERATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP
protocol allows a host to contact a central server which
maintains a list of IP addresses which may be assigned on
one or more subnets. A DHCP client may request an address
from this pool, and then use it on a temporary basis for
communication on network. The DHCP protocol also provides a
mechanism whereby a client can learn important details about
the network to which it is attached, such as the location of
a default router, the location of a name server, and so
on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
versions of the DHCP protocol DHCPv4 and DHCPv6. At startup
the client may be started for one or the other via the
<b>-4</b> or <b>-6</b> options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">On startup,
<b>dhclient</b> reads the dhclient.conf for configuration
instructions. It then gets a list of all the network
interfaces that are configured in the current system. For
each interface, it attempts to configure the interface using
the DHCP protocol.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In order to
keep track of leases across system reboots and server
restarts, <b>dhclient</b> keeps a list of leases it has been
assigned in the dhclient.leases file. On startup, after
reading the dhclient.conf file, <b>dhclient</b> reads the
dhclient.leases file to refresh its memory about what leases
it has been assigned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a new
lease is acquired, it is appended to the end of the
dhclient.leases file. In order to prevent the file from
becoming arbitrarily large, from time to time
<b>dhclient</b> creates a new dhclient.leases file from its
in-core lease database. The old version of the
dhclient.leases file is retained under the name
<i>dhclient.leases~</i> until the next time <b>dhclient</b>
rewrites the database.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Old leases are
kept around in case the DHCP server is unavailable when
<b>dhclient</b> is first invoked (generally during the
initial system boot process). In that event, old leases from
the dhclient.leases file which have not yet expired are
tested, and if they are determined to be valid, they are
used until either they expire or the DHCP server becomes
available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A mobile host
which may sometimes need to access a network on which no
DHCP server exists may be preloaded with a lease for a fixed
address on that network. When all attempts to contact a DHCP
server have failed, <b>dhclient</b> will try to validate the
static lease, and if it succeeds, will use that lease until
it is restarted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A mobile host
may also travel to some networks on which DHCP is not
available but BOOTP is. In that case, it may be advantageous
to arrange with the network administrator for an entry on
the BOOTP database, so that the host can boot quickly on
that network rather than cycling through the list of old
leases.</p>

<h2>COMMAND LINE
<a name="COMMAND LINE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The names of
the network interfaces that <b>dhclient</b> should attempt
to configure may be specified on the command line. If no
interface names are specified on the command line
<b>dhclient</b> will normally identify all network
interfaces, eliminating non-broadcast interfaces if
possible, and attempt to configure each interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to specify interfaces by name in the dhclient.conf
file. If interfaces are specified in this way, then the
client will only configure interfaces that are either
specified in the configuration file or on the command line,
and will ignore all other interfaces.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The client
normally prints no output during its startup sequence. It
can be made to emit verbose messages displaying the startup
sequence events until it has acquired an address by
supplying the <b>-v</b> command line argument. In either
case, the client logs messages using the <b>syslog(3)</b>
facility.</p>

<p>Use the DHCPv6 protocol to obtain whatever IPv6
addresses are available along with configuration parameters.
It cannot be combined with <b>-4</b>. The <b>-S -T -P -N</b>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-4o6&nbsp;</b><i>port</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Participate in the DHCPv4 over
DHCPv6 protocol specified by RFC 7341. This associates a
DHCPv4 and a DHCPv6 client to allow the v4 client to send v4
requests encapsulated in a v6 packet. Communication between
the two clients is done on a pair of UDP sockets bound to
::1 <i>port</i> and <i>port + 1</i>. Both clients must be
launched using the same <i>port</i> argument.</p>

<p>Force <b>dhclient</b> to run as a foreground process.
Normally the DHCP client will run in the foreground until is
has configured an interface at which time it will revert to
running in the background. This option is useful when
running the client under a debugger, or when running it out
of inittab on System V systems. This implies <b>-v</b>.</p></td></tr>

<p>Continue running even if no broadcast interfaces were
found. Normally DHCP client will exit if it isn&rsquo;t able
to identify any network interfaces to configure. On laptop
computers and other computers with hot-swappable I/O buses,
it is possible that a broadcast interface may be added after
system startup. This flag can be used to cause the client
not to exit when it doesn&rsquo;t find any such interfaces.
The <b>omshell(1)</b> program can then be used to notify the
client when a network interface has been added or removed,
so that the client can attempt to configure an IP address on
that interface.</p></td></tr>

</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-e&nbsp;</b><i>VAR=value</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Define additional environment
variables for the environment where <b>dhclient-script</b>
executes. You may specify multiple <b>-e</b> options on the
command line.</p>

<p>Release the current lease and stop the running DHCP
client as previously recorded in the PID file. When shutdown
via this method <b>dhclient-script</b> will be executed with
the specific reason for calling the script set. The client
normally doesn&rsquo;t release the current lease as this is
not required by the DHCP protocol but some cable ISPs
require their clients to notify the server if they wish to
release an assigned IP address.</p></td></tr>

specific reason for calling the script set.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-p&nbsp;</b><i>port-number</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The UDP port number on which
the DHCP client should listen and transmit. If unspecified,
<b>dhclient</b> uses the default port of 68. This is mostly
useful for debugging purposes. If a different port is
specified on which the client should listen and transmit,
the client will also use a different destination port - one
less than the specified port.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-s&nbsp;</b><i>server-addr</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the server IP address
or fully qualified domain name to use as a destination for
DHCP protocol messages before <b>dhclient</b> has acquired
an IP address. Normally, <b>dhclient</b> transmits these
messages to 255.255.255.255 (the IP limited broadcast
address). Overriding this is mostly useful for debugging
purposes. This feature is not supported in DHCPv6
(<b>-6</b>) mode.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-g&nbsp;</b><i>relay</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the giaddr field of all
packets to the <i>relay</i> IP address simulating a relay
agent. This is for testing purposes only and should not be
expected to work in any consistent or useful way.</p>

<p>Use a DUID with DHCPv4 clients. If no DUID is available
in the lease file one will be constructed and saved. The
DUID will be used to construct a RFC4361 style client id
that will be included in the client&rsquo;s messages. This
client id can be overridden by setting a client id in the
configuration file. Overriding the client id in this fashion
is discouraged.</p></td></tr>

</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--decline-wait-time&nbsp;</b><i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the time (in seconds)
that an IPv4 client should wait after declining an address
before issuing a discover. The default is 10 seconds as
recommended by RFC 2131, Section 3.1.5. A value of zero
equates to no wait at all.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--version</b>

<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-T</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Ask for IPv6 temporary addresses, one set per <b>-T</b>
flag. This implies <b>-6</b> and also disables the normal
address query. See <b>-N</b> to restore it.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="3%">


<p><b>-P</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>

<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Require that responses include all of the items
requested by any <b>-N</b>, <b>-T</b>, or <b>-P</b> options.
Normally even if the command line includes a number of these
the client will be willing to accept the best lease it can
even if the lease doesn&rsquo;t include all of the requested
items. This option causes the client to only accept leases
that include all of the requested items.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note well:
enabling this may prevent the client from using any leases
it receives if the servers aren&rsquo;t configured to supply
all of the items.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-D&nbsp;</b><i>LL&nbsp;or&nbsp;LLT</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Override the default when
selecting the type of DUID to use. By default, DHCPv6
<b>dhclient</b> creates an identifier based on the
link-layer address (DUID-LL) if it is running in stateless
mode (with <b>-S</b>, not requesting an address), or it
creates an identifier based on the link-layer address plus a
timestamp (DUID-LLT) if it is running in stateful mode
(without <b>-S</b>, requesting an address). When DHCPv4 is
configured to use a DUID using <b>-i</b> option the default
is to use a DUID-LLT. <b>-D</b> overrides these default,
with a value of either <i>LL</i> or <i>LLT</i>.</p>

<p><b>-N</b></p></td>
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>Restore normal address query for IPv6. This implies
<b>-6</b>. It is used to restore normal operation after
using <b>-T</b> or <b>-P</b>. Multiple addresses can be
requested with multiple <b>-N</b> flags.</p></td></tr>
</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--address-prefix-len&nbsp;</b><i>length</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify the length of the
prefix for IPv6 addresses. This value is passed by dhclient
into the client script via the environment variable,
ip6_prefixlen, when binding IPv6 addresses. The default
value is 128. Alternatively you may change the default at
compile time by setting DHCLIENT_DEFAULT_PREFIX_LEN in
includes/site.h.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--dad-wait-time&nbsp;</b><i>seconds</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify maximum time (in
seconds) that the client should wait for the duplicate
address detection (DAD) to complete on an interface. This
value is propagated to the dhclient script in a
dad_wait_time environment variable. If any of the IPv6
addresses on the interface are tentative (DAD is in
progress), the script will wait for the specified number of
seconds for DAD to complete. If the script ignores this
variable the parameter has no effect.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--prefix-len-hint&nbsp;</b><i>length</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When used in conjunction with
-P, it directs the client to use the given length to use a
prefix hint of, &quot;::/length&quot;, when requesting new
prefixes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Modifying
default file locations:</i> The following options can be
used to modify the locations a client uses for its files.
They can be particularly useful if, for example,
<b>/var/lib/dhcp</b> or <b>/var/run</b> have not been
mounted when the DHCP client is started. <b><br>
-cf&nbsp;</b><i>config-file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path to the client
configuration file. If unspecified, the default
<b>/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf</b> is used. See
<b>dhclient.conf(5)</b> for a description of this file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-df&nbsp;</b><i>duid-lease-file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path to a secondary lease file.
If the primary lease file doesn&rsquo;t contain a DUID this
file will be searched. The DUID read from the secondary will
be written to the primary. This option can be used to allow
an IPv4 instance of the client to share a DUID with an IPv6
instance. After starting one of the instances the second can
be started with this option pointing to the lease file of
the first instance. There is no default. If no file is
specified no search is made for a DUID should one not be
found in the main lease file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-lf&nbsp;</b><i>lease-file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path to the lease database
file. If unspecified, the default
<b>/var/lib/dhcp/dhclient.leases</b> is used. See
<b>dhclient.leases(5)</b> for a description of this
file.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-pf&nbsp;</b><i>pid-file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path to the process ID file. If
unspecified, the default <b>/var/run/dhclient.pid</b> is
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>--no-pid</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Option to disable writing pid
files. By default the program will write a pid file. If the
program is invoked with this option it will not attempt to
kill any existing client processes even if invoked with
<b>-r</b> or <b>-x</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-sf&nbsp;</b><i>script-file</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Path to the network
configuration script invoked by <b>dhclient</b> when it gets
a lease. If unspecified, the default
<b>/sbin/dhclient-script</b> is used. See
<b>dhclient-script(8)</b> for a description of this
file.</p>

<h2>PORTS
<a name="PORTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">During
operations the client may use multiple UDP ports to provide
different functions. Which ports are opened depends on both
the way you compiled your code and the configuration you
supply. The following should provide you an idea of what
ports may be in use.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Normally a
DHCPv4 client will open a raw UDP socket to receive and send
most DHCPv4 packets. It also opens a fallback UDP socket for
use in sending unicast packets. Normally these will both use
the well known port number for BOOTPC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For DHCPv6 the
client opens a UDP socket on the well known client port and
a fallback UDP socket on a random port for use in sending
unicast messages. Unlike DHCPv4 the well known socket
doesn&rsquo;t need to be opened in raw mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If you have
included an omapi port statement in your configuration file
then the client will open a TCP socket on that port to
listen for OMPAI connections. When something connects
another port will be used for the established
connection.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When DDNS is
enabled at compile time (see includes/site.h) the client
will open both a v4 and a v6 UDP socket on random ports.
These ports are not opened unless/until the client first
attempts to do an update. If the client is not configured to
do updates, the ports will never be opened.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION
<a name="CONFIGURATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The syntax of
the <b>dhclient.conf(5)</b> file is discussed
separately.</p>

<h2>OMAPI
<a name="OMAPI"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The DHCP client
provides some ability to control it while it is running,
without stopping it. This capability is provided using
OMAPI, an API for manipulating remote objects. OMAPI clients
connect to the client using TCP/IP, authenticate, and can
then examine the client&rsquo;s current status and make
changes to it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Rather than
implementing the underlying OMAPI protocol directly, user
programs should use the dhcpctl API or OMAPI itself. Dhcpctl
is a wrapper that handles some of the housekeeping chores
that OMAPI does not do automatically. Dhcpctl and OMAPI are
documented in <b>dhcpctl(3)</b> and <b>omapi(3)</b>. Most
things you&rsquo;d want to do with the client can be done
directly using the <b>omshell(1)</b> command, rather than
having to write a special program.</p>

<h2>THE CONTROL OBJECT
<a name="THE CONTROL OBJECT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The control
object allows you to shut the client down, releasing all
leases that it holds and deleting any DNS records it may
have added. It also allows you to pause the client - this
unconfigures any interfaces the client is using. You can
then restart it, which causes it to reconfigure those
interfaces. You would normally pause the client prior to
going into hibernation or sleep on a laptop computer. You
would then resume it after the power comes back. This allows
PC cards to be shut down while the computer is hibernating
or sleeping, and then reinitialized to their previous state
once the computer comes out of hibernation or sleep.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The control
object has one attribute - the state attribute. To shut the
client down, set its state attribute to 2. It will
automatically do a DHCPRELEASE. To pause it, set its state
attribute to 3. To resume it, set its state attribute to
4.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
<a name="ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This client was
substantially modified and enhanced by Elliot Poger for use
on Linux while he was working on the MosquitoNet project at
Stanford.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The current
version owes much to Elliot&rsquo;s Linux enhancements, but
was substantially reorganized and partially rewritten by Ted
Lemon so as to use the same networking framework that the
Internet Systems Consortium DHCP server uses. Much
system-specific configuration code was moved into a shell
script so that as support for more operating systems is
added, it will not be necessary to port and maintain
system-specific configuration code to these operating
systems - instead, the shell script can invoke the native
tools to accomplish the same purpose.</p>
