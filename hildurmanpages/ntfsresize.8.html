<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">ntfsresize -
resize an NTFS filesystem without data loss</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ntfsresize</b>
[<i>OPTIONS</i>] <b>--info(-mb-only)</b> <i>DEVICE</i>
<b><br>
ntfsresize</b> [<i>OPTIONS</i>] [<b>--size</b>
<i>SIZE</i>[<b>k</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>G</b>]] <i>DEVICE</i></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>ntfsresize</b> program safely resizes Windows XP, Windows
Server 2003, Windows 2000, Windows NT4 and Longhorn NTFS
filesystems without data loss. All NTFS versions are
supported, used by 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.
<b>Defragmentation is NOT required prior to resizing</b>
because the program can relocate any data if needed, without
risking data integrity.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Ntfsresize can
be used to shrink or enlarge any NTFS filesystem located on
an unmounted <i>DEVICE</i> (usually a disk partition). The
new filesystem will fit in a DEVICE whose desired size is
<i>SIZE</i> bytes. The <i>SIZE</i> parameter may have one of
the optional modifiers <b>k</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>G</b>, which
means the <i>SIZE</i> parameter is given in kilo-, mega- or
gigabytes respectively. <b>Ntfsresize</b> conforms to the
SI, ATA, IEEE standards and the disk manufacturers by using
k=10^3, M=10^6 and G=10^9.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If both
<b>--info(-mb-only)</b> and <b>--size</b> are omitted then
the NTFS filesystem will be enlarged to match the underlying
<i>DEVICE</i> size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To resize a
filesystem on a partition, you must resize BOTH the
filesystem and the partition by editing the partition table
on the disk. Similarly to other command line filesystem
resizers, <b>ntfsresize</b> doesn&rsquo;t manipulate the
size of the partitions, hence to do that you must use a disk
partitioning tool as well, for example <b>fdisk</b>(8).
Alternatively you could use one of the many user friendly
partitioners that uses <b>ntfsresize</b> internally, like
Mandriva&rsquo;s DiskDrake, QTParted, SUSE/Novell&rsquo;s
YaST Partitioner, IBM&rsquo;s EVMS, GParted or
Debian/Ubuntu&rsquo;s Partman.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>IMPORTANT!</b>
It&rsquo;s a good practice making REGULAR BACKUPS of your
valuable data, especially before using ANY partitioning
tools. To do so for NTFS, you could use <b>ntfsclone</b>(8).
Don&rsquo;t forget to save the partition table as well!</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Shrinkage</b>
<br>
If you wish to shrink an NTFS partition, first use
<b>ntfsresize</b> to shrink the size of the filesystem. Then
you could use <b>fdisk</b>(8) to shrink the size of the
partition by deleting the partition and recreating it with
the smaller size. Do not make the partition smaller than the
new size of NTFS otherwise you won&rsquo;t be able to boot.
If you did so notwithstanding then just recreate the
partition to be as large as NTFS.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Enlargement</b>
<br>
To enlarge an NTFS filesystem, first you must enlarge the
size of the underlying partition. This can be done using
<b>fdisk</b>(8) by deleting the partition and recreating it
with a larger size. Make sure it will not overlap with
another existing partition. You may enlarge upwards (first
sector unchanged) or downwards (last sector unchanged), but
you may not enlarge at both ends in a single step. If you
merge two NTFS partitions, only one of them can be expanded
to the merged partition. After you have enlarged the
partition, you may use <b>ntfsresize</b> to enlarge the size
of the filesystem.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Partitioning</b>
<br>
When recreating the partition by a disk partitioning tool,
make sure you create it at the same starting sector and with
the same partition type as before. Otherwise you won&rsquo;t
be able to access your filesystem. Use the &rsquo;u&rsquo;
fdisk command to switch to the reliable sector unit from the
default cylinder one.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Also make sure
you set the bootable flag for the partition if it existed
before. Failing to do so you might not be able to boot your
computer from the disk.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Below is a
summary of all the options that <b>ntfsresize</b> accepts.
Nearly all options have two equivalent names. The short name
is preceded by <b>-</b> and the long name is preceded by
<b>--</b>. Any single letter options, that don&rsquo;t take
an argument, can be combined into a single command, e.g.
<b>-fv</b> is equivalent to <b>-f -v</b>. Long named options
can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.
<b><br>
-c</b>, <b>--check</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By using this option ntfsresize
will only check the device to ensure that it is ready to be
resized. If not, it will print any errors detected. If the
device is fine, nothing will be printed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-i</b>, <b>--info</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By using this option without
<b>--expand</b>, ntfsresize will determine the theoretically
smallest shrunken filesystem size supported. Most of the
time the result is the space already used on the filesystem.
Ntfsresize will refuse shrinking to a smaller size than what
you got by this option and depending on several factors it
might be unable to shrink very close to this theoretical
size. Although the integrity of your data should be never in
risk, it&rsquo;s still strongly recommended to make a test
run by using the <b>--no-action</b> option before real
resizing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Practically the
smallest shrunken size generally is at around &quot;used
space&quot; + (20-200 MB). Please also take into account
that Windows might need about 50-100 MB free space left to
boot safely.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If used in
association with option <b>--expand</b>, ntfsresize will
determine the smallest downwards expansion size and the
possible increments to the size. These are exact byte counts
which must not be rounded. This option may be used after the
partition has been expanded provided the upper bound has not
been changed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option
never causes any changes to the filesystem, the partition is
opened read-only.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-m</b>,
<b>--info-mb-only</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Like the info option, only
print out the shrinkable size in MB. Print nothing if the
shrink size is the same as the original size (in MB). This
option cannot be used in association with option
<b>--expand</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-s</b>, <b>--size</b>
SIZE[<b>k</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>G</b>]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Resize filesystem to fit in a
partition whose size is
<i>SIZE</i>[<b>k</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>G</b>] bytes by shifting
its end and keeping its beginning unchanged. The filesystem
size is set to be at least one sector smaller than the
partition. The optional modifiers <b>k</b>, <b>M</b>,
<b>G</b> mean the <i>SIZE</i> parameter is given in kilo-,
mega- or gigabytes respectively. Conforming to standards,
k=10^3, M=10^6 and G=10^9. ki=2^10, Mi=2^20 and Gi=2^30 are
also allowed. Use this option with <b>--no-action</b>
first.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-x</b>, <b>--expand</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Expand the filesystem to the
current partition size, shifting down its beginning and
keeping its end unchanged. The metadata is recreated in the
expanded space and no user data is relocated. This is
incompatible with option -s (or --size) and can only be made
if the expanded space is an exact multiple of the cluster
size. It must also be large enough to hold the new
metadata.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If the
expansion is interrupted for some reason (power outage,
etc), you may restart the resizing, as the original data and
metadata have been kept unchanged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note :
expanding a Windows system partition and filesystem
downwards may lead to the registry or some files not
matching the new system layout, or to some important files
being located too far from the beginning of the partition,
thus making Windows not bootable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Forces ntfsresize to proceed
with the resize operation either without prompting for an
explicit acceptance, or if the filesystem is marked for
consistency check. Double the option (-ff, --force --force)
to avoid prompting even if the file system is marked for
check.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Please note,
ntfsresize always marks the filesystem for consistency check
before a real resize operation and it leaves that way for
extra safety. Thus if NTFS was marked by ntfsresize then
it&rsquo;s safe to use this option. If you need to resize
several times without booting into Windows between each
resizing steps then you must use this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-n, --no-action</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this option to make a test
run before doing the real resize operation. Volume will be
opened read-only and <b>ntfsresize</b> displays what it
would do if it were to resize the filesystem. Continue with
the real resizing only if the test run passed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-b</b>,
<b>--bad-sectors</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Support disks having hardware
errors, bad sectors with those <b>ntfsresize</b> would
refuse to work by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Prior using
this option, it&rsquo;s strongly recommended to make a
backup by <b>ntfsclone</b>(8) using the --rescue option,
then running &rsquo;chkdsk /f /r volume:&rsquo; on Windows
from the command line. If the disk guarantee is still valid
then replace it. It&rsquo;s defected. Please also note, that
no software can repair these type of hardware errors. The
most what they can do is to work around the permanent
defects.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This option
doesn&rsquo;t have any effect if the disk is flawless.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-P</b>,
<b>--no-progress-bar</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Don&rsquo;t show progress
bars.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">More output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Print the version number of
<b>ntfsresize</b> and exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Display help and exit.</p>

<h2>EXIT CODES
<a name="EXIT CODES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exit code
is 0 on success, non-zero otherwise.</p>

<h2>KNOWN ISSUES
<a name="KNOWN ISSUES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">No reliability
problem is known. If you find a bug please send an email
describing the problem to the development team at: <br>
ntfs-3g-devel@lists.sf.net</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are a few
very rarely met restrictions at present: filesystems having
unknown bad sectors, relocation of the first MFT extent and
resizing into the middle of a $MFTMirr extent aren&rsquo;t
supported yet. These cases are detected and resizing is
restricted to a safe size or the closest safe size is
displayed.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Ntfsresize</b>
schedules an NTFS consistency check and after the first boot
into Windows you must see <b>chkdsk</b> running on a blue
background. This is intentional and no need to worry about
it. Windows may force a quick reboot after the consistency
check. Moreover after repartitioning your disk and depending
on the hardware configuration, the Windows message <b>System
Settings Change</b> may also appear. Just acknowledge it and
reboot again.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The disk
geometry handling semantic (HDIO_GETGEO ioctl) has changed
in an incompatible way in Linux 2.6 kernels and this
triggered multitudinous partition table corruptions
resulting in unbootable Windows systems, even if NTFS was
consistent, if <b>parted</b>(8) was involved in some way.
This problem was often attributed to ntfsresize but in fact
it&rsquo;s completely independent of NTFS thus ntfsresize.
Moreover ntfsresize never touches the partition table at
all. By changing the &rsquo;Disk Access Mode&rsquo; to LBA
in the BIOS makes booting work again, most of the time. You
can find more information about this issue in the
Troubleshooting section of the below referred Ntfsresize
FAQ.</p>
