<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>systemd-resolved</b>
is a system service that provides network name resolution to
local applications. It implements a caching and validating
DNS/DNSSEC stub resolver, as well as an LLMNR and
MulticastDNS resolver and responder. Local applications may
submit network name resolution requests via three
interfaces:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; The
native, fully-featured API <b>systemd-resolved</b> exposes
on the bus. See the <b><font color="#0000FF">API
Documentation</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">for details. Usage of this API is
generally recommended to clients as it is asynchronous and
fully featured (for example, properly returns DNSSEC
validation status and interface scope for addresses as
necessary for supporting link-local networking).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The glibc <b>getaddrinfo</b>(3) API as defined by</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">RFC3493</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[2]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">and its related resolver functions,
including <b>gethostbyname</b>(3). This API is widely
supported, including beyond the Linux platform. In its
current form it does not expose DNSSEC validation status
information however, and is synchronous only. This API is
backed by the glibc Name Service Switch (<b>nss</b>(5)).
Usage of the glibc NSS module <b>nss-resolve</b>(8) is
required in order to allow glibc's NSS resolver functions to
resolve host names via <b>systemd-resolved</b>.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Additionally, <b>systemd-resolved</b> provides a local DNS
stub listener on IP address 127.0.0.53 on the local loopback
interface. Programs issuing DNS requests directly, bypassing
any local API may be directed to this stub, in order to
connect them to <b>systemd-resolved</b>. Note however that
it is strongly recommended that local programs use the glibc
NSS or bus APIs instead (as described above), as various
network resolution concepts (such as link-local addressing,
or LLMNR Unicode domains) cannot be mapped to the unicast
DNS protocol.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
DNS servers contacted are determined from the global
settings in /etc/systemd/resolved.conf, the per-link static
settings in /etc/systemd/network/*.network files (in case
<b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) is used), the per-link
dynamic settings received over DHCP, user request made via
<b>resolvectl</b>(1), and any DNS server information made
available by other system services. See
<b>resolved.conf</b>(5) and <b>systemd.network</b>(5) for
details about systemd's own configuration files for DNS
servers. To improve compatibility, /etc/resolv.conf is read
in order to discover configured system DNS servers, but only
if it is not a symlink to
/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf,
/usr/lib/systemd/resolv.conf or
/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf (see below).</font></p>

<h2>SYNTHETIC RECORDS
<a name="SYNTHETIC RECORDS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>systemd-resolved</b>
synthesizes DNS resource records (RRs) for the following
cases:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The local, configured hostname is resolved to all locally
configured IP addresses ordered by their scope, or &mdash;
if none are configured &mdash; the IPv4 address 127.0.0.2
(which is on the local loopback) and the IPv6 address ::1
(which is the local host).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The hostnames &quot;localhost&quot; and
&quot;localhost.localdomain&quot; (as well as any hostname
ending in &quot;.localhost&quot; or
&quot;.localhost.localdomain&quot;) are resolved to the IP
addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The hostname &quot;_gateway&quot; is resolved to all current
default routing gateway addresses, ordered by their metric.
This assigns a stable hostname to the current gateway,
useful for referencing it independently of the current
network configuration state.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
The mappings defined in /etc/hosts are resolved to their
configured addresses and back, but they will not affect
lookups for non-address types (like MX).</font></p>

<h2>PROTOCOLS AND ROUTING
<a name="PROTOCOLS AND ROUTING"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Lookup
requests are routed to the available DNS servers, LLMNR and
MulticastDNS interfaces according to the following
rules:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Lookups for the special hostname &quot;localhost&quot; are
never routed to the network. (A few other, special domains
are handled the same way.)</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Single-label names are routed to all local interfaces
capable of IP multicasting, using the LLMNR protocol.
Lookups for IPv4 addresses are only sent via LLMNR on IPv4,
and lookups for IPv6 addresses are only sent via LLMNR on
IPv6. Lookups for the locally configured host name and the
&quot;_gateway&quot; host name are never routed to
LLMNR.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Multi-label names with the domain suffix &quot;.local&quot;
are routed to all local interfaces capable of IP
multicasting, using the MulticastDNS protocol. As with LLMNR
IPv4 address lookups are sent via IPv4 and IPv6 address
lookups are sent via IPv6.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Other multi-label names are routed to all local interfaces
that have a DNS server configured, plus the globally
configured DNS server if there is one. Address lookups from
the link-local address range are never routed to DNS. Note
that by default lookups for domains with the
&quot;.local&quot; suffix are not routed to DNS servers,
unless the domain is specified explicitly as routing or
search domain for the DNS server and interface. This means
that on networks where the &quot;.local&quot; domain is
defined in a site-specific DNS server, explicit search or
routing domains need to be configured to make lookups within
this DNS domain work. Note that today it's generally
recommended to avoid defining &quot;.local&quot; in a DNS
server, as</font>
<b><font color="#0000FF">RFC6762</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[3]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">reserves this domain for exclusive
MulticastDNS use.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
lookups are routed to multiple interfaces, the first
successful response is returned (thus effectively merging
the lookup zones on all matching interfaces). If the lookup
failed on all interfaces, the last failing response is
returned.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Routing
of lookups may be influenced by configuring per-interface
domain names and other settings. See
<b>systemd.network</b>(5) and <b>resolvectl</b>(1) for
details. The following query routing logic applies for
unicast DNS traffic:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
If a name to look up matches (that is: is equal to or has as
suffix) any of the configured search or route-only domains
of any link (or the globally configured DNS settings), the
&quot;best matching&quot; search/route-only domain is
determined: the matching one with the most labels. The query
is then sent to all DNS servers of any links or the globally
configured DNS servers associated with this &quot;best
matching&quot; search/route-only domain. (Note that more
than one link might have this same &quot;best matching&quot;
search/route-only domain configured, in which case the query
is sent to all of them in parallel).</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
If a query does not match any configured search/route-only
domain (neither per-link nor global), it is sent to all DNS
servers that are configured on links with the &quot;DNS
default route&quot; option set, as well as the globally
configured DNS server.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
If there is no link configured as &quot;DNS default
route&quot; and no global DNS server configured, the
compiled-in fallback DNS server is used.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Otherwise the query is failed as no suitable DNS servers
could be determined.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">The
&quot;DNS default route&quot; option is a boolean setting
configurable with <b>resolvectl</b> or in .network files. If
not set, it is implicitly determined based on the configured
DNS domains for a link: if there's any route-only domain
(not matching &quot;~.&quot;) it defaults to false,
otherwise to true.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Effectively
this means: in order to preferably route all DNS queries not
explicitly matched by search/route-only domain configuration
to a specific link, configure a &quot;~.&quot; route-only
domain on it. This will ensure that other links will not be
considered for the queries (unless they too carry such a
route-only domain). In order to route all such DNS queries
to a specific link only in case no other link is preferable,
then set the &quot;DNS default route&quot; option for the
link to true, and do not configure a &quot;~.&quot;
route-only domain on it. Finally, in order to ensure that a
specific link never receives any DNS traffic not matching
any of its configured search/route-only domains, set the
&quot;DNS default route&quot; option for it to
false.</font></p>

<h2>/ETC/RESOLV.CONF
<a name="/ETC/RESOLV.CONF"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Four
modes of handling /etc/resolv.conf (see
<b>resolv.conf</b>(5)) are supported:</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
<b>systemd-resolved</b> maintains the
/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf file for compatibility
with traditional Linux programs. This file may be symlinked
from /etc/resolv.conf. This file lists the 127.0.0.53 DNS
stub (see above) as the only DNS server. It also contains a
list of search domains that are in use by systemd-resolved.
The list of search domains is always kept up-to-date. Note
that /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf should not be
used directly by applications, but only through a symlink
from /etc/resolv.conf. This file may be symlinked from
/etc/resolv.conf in order to connect all local clients that
bypass local DNS APIs to <b>systemd-resolved</b> with
correct search domains settings. This mode of operation is
recommended.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
A static file /usr/lib/systemd/resolv.conf is provided that
lists the 127.0.0.53 DNS stub (see above) as only DNS
server. This file may be symlinked from /etc/resolv.conf in
order to connect all local clients that bypass local DNS
APIs to <b>systemd-resolved</b>. This file does not contain
any search domains.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
<b>systemd-resolved</b> maintains the
/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf file for compatibility with
traditional Linux programs. This file may be symlinked from
/etc/resolv.conf and is always kept up-to-date, containing
information about all known DNS servers. Note the file
format's limitations: it does not know a concept of
per-interface DNS servers and hence only contains
system-wide DNS server definitions. Note that
/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf should not be used directly
by applications, but only through a symlink from
/etc/resolv.conf. If this mode of operation is used local
clients that bypass any local DNS API will also bypass
<b>systemd-resolved</b> and will talk directly to the known
DNS servers.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">&bull;
Alternatively, /etc/resolv.conf may be managed by other
packages, in which case <b>systemd-resolved</b> will read it
for DNS configuration data. In this mode of operation
<b>systemd-resolved</b> is consumer rather than provider of
this configuration file.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that the selected mode of operation for this file is
detected fully automatically, depending on whether
/etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to
/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf or lists 127.0.0.53 as DNS
server.</font></p>

<h2>SIGNALS
<a name="SIGNALS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>SIGUSR1</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Upon
reception of the <b>SIGUSR1</b> process signal
<b>systemd-resolved</b> will dump the contents of all DNS
resource record caches it maintains, as well as all feature
level information it learnt about configured DNS servers
into the system logs.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>SIGUSR2</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Upon
reception of the <b>SIGUSR2</b> process signal
<b>systemd-resolved</b> will flush all caches it maintains.
Note that it should normally not be necessary to request
this explicitly &ndash; except for debugging purposes
&ndash; as <b>systemd-resolved</b> flushes the caches
automatically anyway any time the host's network
configuration changes. Sending this signal to
<b>systemd-resolved</b> is equivalent to the <b>resolvectl
flush-caches</b> command, however the latter is recommended
since it operates in a synchronous way.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><b>SIGRTMIN+1</b></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Upon
reception of the <b>SIGRTMIN+1</b> process signal
<b>systemd-resolved</b> will forget everything it learnt
about the configured DNS servers. Specifically any
information about server feature support is flushed out, and
the server feature probing logic is restarted on the next
request, starting with the most fully featured level. Note
that it should normally not be necessary to request this
explicitly &ndash; except for debugging purposes &ndash; as
<b>systemd-resolved</b> automatically forgets learnt
information any time the DNS server configuration changes.
Sending this signal to <b>systemd-resolved</b> is equivalent
to the <b>resolvectl reset-server-features</b> command,
however the latter is recommended since it operates in a
synchronous way.</font></p>
