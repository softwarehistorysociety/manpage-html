<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This utility
attempts to download microcode to an enclosure (or one of
its sub-enclosures) associated with the <i>DEVICE</i>. The
process for doing this is defined in the SCSI Enclosure
Services (SES) standards and drafts maintained by the T10
committee.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The process is
to send one or more sequences containing a SCSI SEND
DIAGNOSTIC command followed optionally by a RECEIVE
DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command. The former sends a Download
microcode Control diagnostic page (dpage) and the latter
fetches a Download microcode status dpage which can be
viewed as a report on the former command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
action (i.e. when the <i>--mode=MO</i> option is not given)
is to fetch the Download microcode status dpage and decode
it. This does not require the microcode (firmware) itself so
the <i>--in=FILE</i> option is not required.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The most recent
reference for this utility is the draft SCSI Enclosure
Services 3 (SES-3) document T10/2149-D Revision 7 at
http://www.t10.org . Existing standards for SES and SES-2
are ANSI INCITS 305-1998 and ANSI INCITS 448-2008
respectively.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most other
support for SES in this package (apart from downloading
microcode) can be found in the sg_ses utility. Another way
of downloading firmware to a SCSI device is with the WRITE
BUFFER command defined in SPC-4, see the sg_write_buffer
utility.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Arguments to
long options are mandatory for short options as well.
<b><br>
-b</b>, <b>--bpw</b>=<i>CS</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where <i>CS</i> is the chunk
size in bytes and should be a multiple of 4. This will be
the maximum number of bytes sent per SEND DIAGNOSTIC
command. So if <i>CS</i> is less than the effective length
of the microcode then multiple SEND DIAGNOSTIC commands are
sent, each taking the next chunk from the read data and
increasing the buffer offset field in the Download microcode
control dpage by the appropriate amount. The default is a
chunk size of 0 which is interpreted as a very large number
hence only one SEND DIAGNOSTIC command will be sent. <br>
The number in <i>CS</i> can optionally be followed by
&quot;,act&quot; or &quot;,activate&quot;. In this case
after the microcode has been successfully sent to the
<i>DEVICE</i>, an additional Download microcode control
dpage with its mode set to &quot;Activate deferred
microcode&quot; [0xf] is sent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-d</b>, <b>--dry-run</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">the actual calls to perform
SEND DIAGNOSTIC and RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS commands are
skipped when this option is given. No SCSI commands are sent
to the <i>DEVICE</i> but it is still opened and is required
to be given. A dummy device such as /dev/null (in Unix) can
be used. <br>
This utility expects a &quot;sensible&quot; response to the
RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command it sends (and will abort
if it doesn&rsquo;t receive one). So this option supplies
dummy responses with one primary enclosure and three
sub-enclosures. The dummy responses include good status
values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-e</b>, <b>--ealsd</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">exit after last SEND DIAGNOSTIC
command. A SES device should not start its firmware update
immediately after the last received &quot;chunk&quot; of its
firmware. Rather it should wait till at least one RECEIVE
DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command is sent to give the device a
chance to report any error. However some devices do start
the firmware update immediately which causes the trailing
RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command to be held up and often
be aborted with a &quot;target reset&quot; error. <br>
This option causes the trailing RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS
command to be skipped. This option would be typically used
with the <i>--bpw=CS</i> option. <br>
Prior to version 1.10 of this utility [20180112] this (i.e.
skipping the last RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command) was
the default action.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">output the usage message then
exit. If used multiple times also prints the mode names and
their acronyms.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-i</b>,
<b>--id</b>=<i>ID</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">this option sets the BUFFER ID
field in the Download microcode control dpage. <i>ID</i> is
a value between 0 (default) and 255 inclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-I</b>,
<b>--in</b>=<i>FILE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">read data from file <i>FILE</i>
that will be sent with the SEND DIAGNOSTIC command. If
<i>FILE</i> is &rsquo;-&rsquo; then stdin is read until an
EOF is detected (this is the same action as <i>--raw</i>).
Data is read from the beginning of <i>FILE</i> except in the
case when it is a regular file and the <i>--skip=SKIP</i>
option is given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-l</b>,
<b>--length</b>=<i>LEN</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where <i>LEN</i> is the length,
in bytes, of data to be written to the device. If not given
(and the length cannot be deduced from <i>--in=FILE</i> or
<i>--raw</i>) then defaults to zero. If the option is given
and the length deduced from <i>--in=FILE</i> or <i>--raw</i>
is less (or no data is provided), then bytes of 0xff are
used as fill bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-m</b>,
<b>--mode</b>=<i>MO</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">this option sets the MODE.
<i>MO</i> is a value between 0 (which is dmc_status and the
default) and 255 inclusive. Alternatively an abbreviation
can be given. See the MODES section below. To list the
available mode abbreviations at run time give an invalid one
(e.g. &rsquo;--mode=xxx&rsquo;) or use the &rsquo;-h&rsquo;
option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-N</b>, <b>--non</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">allow for non-standard
implementations that reset their Download microcode engine
after a RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command with the Download
microcode status dpage is sent. When this option is given
sending that command and dpage combination is avoided unless
an error has already occurred.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-o</b>,
<b>--offset</b>=<i>OFF</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">this option sets the BUFFER
OFFSET field in the Download microcode control dpage.
<i>OFF</i> is a value between 0 (default) and 2**32-1 . It
is a byte offset. This option is ignored (and a warning sent
to stderr) if the <i>--bpw=CS</i> option is also given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-s</b>,
<b>--skip</b>=<i>SKIP</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">this option is only active when
<i>--in=FILE</i> is given and <i>FILE</i> is a regular file,
rather than stdin. Data is read starting at byte offset
<i>SKIP</i> to the end of file (or the amount given by
<i>--length=LEN</i>). If not given the byte offset defaults
to 0 (i.e. the start of the file).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-S</b>,
<b>--subenc</b>=<i>SEID</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>SEID</i> is the
sub-enclosure identify. It defaults to 0 which is the
primary enclosure identifier.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-t</b>,
<b>--tlength</b>=<i>TLEN</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>TLEN</i> is the total length
in bytes of the microcode to be (or being) downloaded. It
defaults to 0 which is okay in most cases. This option only
comes into play when <i>TLEN</i> is greater than <i>LEN</i>.
In this case <i>TLEN</i> is sent to the SES <i>DEVICE</i> so
that it knows when it only receives <i>LEN</i> bytes from
this invocation, that it should expect more to be sent in
the near future (e.g. by another invocation). This option is
only needed when sections of microcode are being sent in
separate invocations of this utility (e.g. the microcode is
spread across two files).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">increase the level of
verbosity, (i.e. debug output).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">print the version string and
then exit.</p>

<h2>MODES
<a name="MODES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Following is a
list accepted by the <i>MO</i> argument of this utility.
First shown is an acronym followed in square brackets by the
corresponding decimal and hex values that may also be given
for <i>MO</i>. <br>
dmc_status [0, 0x0]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS
to fetch the Download microcode status dpage and print it
out.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dmc_offs [6, 0x6]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Download microcode with offsets
and activate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dmc_offs_save [7, 0x7]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Download microcode with
offsets, save, and activate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">dmc_offs_defer [14, 0xe]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Download microcode with
offsets, save, and defer activate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">activate_mc [15, 0xf]</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Activate deferred microcode.
There is no follow-up RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS to fetch
the Download microcode status dpage since the <i>DEVICE</i>
might be resetting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Apart from
dmc_status, these are placed in the Download microcode mode
field in the Download microcode control dpage. In the case
of dmc_status the Download microcode status dpage is fetched
with the RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command and decoded.</p>

<h2>WHEN THE DOWNLOAD FAILS
<a name="WHEN THE DOWNLOAD FAILS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Firstly, if it
succeeds, this utility should stay silent and return.
Typically vendors will change the &quot;revision&quot;
string (which is 4 characters long) whenever they release
new firmware. That can be seen in the response to a SCSI
INQUIRY command, for example by using the sg_inq utility. It
is possible that the device needs to be power cycled before
the new microcode becomes active. Also if mode
dmc_offs_defer [0xe] is used to download the microcode, then
another invocation with activate_mc may be needed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If something
goes wrong, there will typically be messages printed out by
this utility. The first thing to check is the microcode
(firmware) file itself. Is it designed for the device model;
has it been corrupted, and if downgrading (i.e. trying to
reinstate older firmware), does the vendor allow that?</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Getting new
firmware on a device is a delicate operation that is not
always well defined by T10&rsquo;s standards and drafts. One
might speculate that they are deliberately vague. In testing
this utility one vendor&rsquo;s interpretation of the
standard was somewhat surprising. The <i>--non</i> option
was added to cope with their interpretation. So if the above
suggestions don&rsquo;t help, try adding the <i>--non</i>
option.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This utility
can handle a maximum size of 128 MB of microcode which
should be sufficient for most purposes. In a system that is
memory constrained, such large allocations of memory may
fail.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The user should
be aware that most operating systems have limits on the
amount of data that can be sent with one SCSI command. In
Linux this depends on the pass through mechanism used (e.g.
block SG_IO or the sg driver) and various setting in sysfs
in the Linux lk 2.6/3 series (e.g.
/sys/block/sda/queue/max_sectors_kb). Devices (i.e. logical
units) also typically have limits on the maximum amount of
data they can handle in one command. These two limitations
suggest that modes containing the word &quot;offset&quot;
together with the <i>--bpw=CS</i> option are required as
firmware files get larger and larger. And <i>CS</i> can be
quite small, for example 4096 bytes, resulting in many SEND
DIAGNOSTIC commands being sent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exact error
from the non-standard implementation was a sense key of
ILLEGAL REQUEST and an asc/ascq code of 0x26,0x0 which is
&quot;Invalid field in parameter list&quot;. If that is seen
try again with the <i>--non</i> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Downloading
incorrect microcode into a device has the ability to render
that device inoperable. One would hope that the device
vendor verifies the data before activating it.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A long
(operating system) timeout of 7200 seconds is set on each
SEND DIAGNOSTIC command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All numbers
given with options are assumed to be decimal. Alternatively
numerical values can be given in hexadecimal preceded by
either &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot; (or has a trailing
&quot;h&quot; or &quot;H&quot;).</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no
microcode/firmware file is given then this utility fetches
and decodes the Download microcode status dpage which could
possibly show another initiator in the process of updating
the microcode. Even if that is happening, fetching the
status page should not cause any problems:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sg_ses_microcode
/dev/sg3 <br>
Download microcode status diagnostic page: <br>
number of secondary sub-enclosures: 0 <br>
generation code: 0x0 <br>
sub-enclosure identifier: 0 [primary] <br>
download microcode status: No download microcode operation
in progress [0x0] <br>
download microcode additional status: 0x0 <br>
download microcode maximum size: 1048576 bytes <br>
download microcode expected buffer id: 0x0 <br>
download microcode expected buffer id offset: 0</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
sends new microcode/firmware to an enclosure. Sending a 1.5
MB file in one command caused the enclosure to lock up
temporarily and did not update the firmware. Breaking the
firmware file into 4 KB chunks (an educated guess) was more
successful:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sg_ses_microcode
-b 4k -m dmc_offs_save -I firmware.bin /dev/sg4</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The firmware
update occurred in the following enclosure power cycle. With
a modern enclosure the Extended Inquiry VPD page gives
indications in which situations a firmware upgrade will take
place.</p>

<h2>EXIT STATUS
<a name="EXIT STATUS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exit status
of sg_ses_microcode is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise
see the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
