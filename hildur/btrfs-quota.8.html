<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">btrfs-quota -
control the global quota status of a btrfs filesystem</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>btrfs
quota</b> <i>&lt;subcommand&gt; &lt;args&gt;</i></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The commands
under <b>btrfs quota</b> are used to affect the global
status of quotas of a btrfs filesystem. The quota groups
(qgroups) are managed by the subcommand <b>btrfs
qgroup</b>(8).</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>Note</big></b>
<br>
Qgroups are different than the traditional user quotas and
designed to track shared and exclusive data per-subvolume.
Please refer to the section <i>HIERARCHICAL QUOTA GROUP
CONCEPTS</i> for a detailed description.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b><big>PERFORMANCE
IMPLICATIONS</big></b> <big><br>
When quotas are activated, they affect all extent
processing, which takes a performance hit. Activation of
qgroups is not recommended unless the user intends to
actually use them.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>STABILITY
STATUS</b> <br>
The qgroup implementation has turned out to be quite
difficult as it affects the core of the filesystem
operation. Qgroup users have hit various corner cases over
time, such as incorrect accounting or system instability.
The situation is gradually improving and issues found and
fixed.</big></p>

<h2>HIERARCHICAL QUOTA GROUP CONCEPTS
<a name="HIERARCHICAL QUOTA GROUP CONCEPTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
concept of quota has a long-standing tradition in the Unix
world. Ever since computers allow multiple users to work
simultaneously in one filesystem, there is the need to
prevent one user from using up the entire space. Every user
should get his fair share of the available
resources.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>In case of
files, the solution is quite straightforward. Each file has
an <i>owner</i> recorded along with it, and it has a size.
Traditional quota just restricts the total size of all files
that are owned by a user. The concept is quite flexible: if
a user hits his quota limit, the administrator can raise it
on the fly.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>On the
other hand, the traditional approach has only a poor
solution to restrict directories. At installation time, the
harddisk can be partitioned so that every directory (eg.
/usr, /var/, ...) that needs a limit gets its own partition.
The obvious problem is that those limits cannot be changed
without a reinstallation. The btrfs subvolume feature builds
a bridge. Subvolumes correspond in many ways to partitions,
as every subvolume looks like its own filesystem. With
subvolume quota, it is now possible to restrict each
subvolume like a partition, but keep the flexibility of
quota. The space for each subvolume can be expanded or
restricted on the fly.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>As
subvolumes are the basis for snapshots, interesting
questions arise as to how to account used space in the
presence of snapshots. If you have a file shared between a
subvolume and a snapshot, whom to account the file to? The
creator? Both? What if the file gets modified in the
snapshot, should only these changes be accounted to it? But
wait, both the snapshot and the subvolume belong to the same
user home. I just want to limit the total space used by
both! But somebody else might not want to charge the
snapshots to the users.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Btrfs
subvolume quota solves these problems by introducing groups
of subvolumes and let the user put limits on them. It is
even possible to have groups of groups. In the following, we
refer to them as <i>qgroups</i>.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Each
qgroup primarily tracks two numbers, the amount of total
referenced space and the amount of exclusively referenced
space.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>referenced</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>space is the amount of
data that can be reached from any of the subvolumes
contained in the qgroup, while</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>exclusive</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big>is the amount of data
where all references to this data can be reached from within
this qgroup.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>SUBVOLUME
QUOTA GROUPS</b> <br>
The basic notion of the Subvolume Quota feature is the quota
group, short qgroup. Qgroups are notated as <i>level/id</i>,
eg. the qgroup 3/2 is a qgroup of level 3. For level 0, the
leading <i>0/</i> can be omitted. Qgroups of level 0 get
created automatically when a subvolume/snapshot gets
created. The ID of the qgroup corresponds to the ID of the
subvolume, so 0/5 is the qgroup for the root subvolume. For
the <b>btrfs qgroup</b> command, the path to the subvolume
can also be used instead of <i>0/ID</i>. For all higher
levels, the ID can be chosen freely.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Each
qgroup can contain a set of lower level qgroups, thus
creating a hierarchy of qgroups. Figure 1 shows an example
qgroup tree.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>+---+ <br>
|2/1| <br>
+---+ <br>
/ \ <br>
+---+/ \+---+ <br>
|1/1| |1/2| <br>
+---+ +---+ <br>
/ \ / \ <br>
+---+/ \+---+/ \+---+ <br>
qgroups |0/1| |0/2| |0/3| <br>
+-+-+ +---+ +---+ <br>
| / \ / \ <br>
| / \ / \ <br>
| / \ / \ <br>
extents 1 2 3 4</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Figure1:
Sample qgroup hierarchy</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>At the
bottom, some extents are depicted showing which qgroups
reference which extents. It is important to understand the
notion of <i>referenced</i> vs <i>exclusive</i>. In the
example, qgroup 0/2 references extents 2 and 3, while 1/2
references extents 2-4, 2/1 references all
extents.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>On the
other hand, extent 1 is exclusive to 0/1, extent 2 is
exclusive to 0/2, while extent 3 is neither exclusive to 0/2
nor to 0/3. But because both references can be reached from
1/2, extent 3 is exclusive to 1/2. All extents are exclusive
to 2/1.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>So
exclusive does not mean there is no other way to reach the
extent, but it does mean that if you delete all subvolumes
contained in a qgroup, the extent will get
deleted.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Exclusive
of a qgroup conveys the useful information how much space
will be freed in case all subvolumes of the qgroup get
deleted.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>All data
extents are accounted this way. Metadata that belongs to a
specific subvolume (i.e. its filesystem tree) is also
accounted. Checksums and extent allocation information are
not accounted.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>In turn,
the referenced count of a qgroup can be limited. All writes
beyond this limit will lead to a <i>Quota Exceeded</i>
error.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>INHERITANCE</b>
<br>
Things get a bit more complicated when new subvolumes or
snapshots are created. The case of (empty) subvolumes is
still quite easy. If a subvolume should be part of a qgroup,
it has to be added to the qgroup at creation time. To add it
at a later time, it would be necessary to at least rescan
the full subvolume for a proper accounting.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Creation
of a snapshot is the hard case. Obviously, the snapshot will
reference the exact amount of space as its source, and both
source and destination now have an exclusive count of 0 (the
filesystem nodesize to be precise, as the roots of the trees
are not shared). But what about qgroups of higher levels? If
the qgroup contains both the source and the destination,
nothing changes. If the qgroup contains only the source, it
might lose some exclusive.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>But how
much? The tempting answer is, subtract all exclusive of the
source from the qgroup, but that is wrong, or at least not
enough. There could have been an extent that is referenced
from the source and another subvolume from that qgroup. This
extent would have been exclusive to the qgroup, but not to
the source subvolume. With the creation of the snapshot, the
qgroup would also lose this extent from its exclusive
set.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big>So how can
this problem be solved? In the instant the snapshot gets
created, we already have to know the correct exclusive
count. We need to have a second qgroup that contains all the
subvolumes as the first qgroup, except the subvolume we want
to snapshot. The moment we create the snapshot, the
exclusive count from the second qgroup needs to be copied to
the first qgroup, as it represents the correct value. The
second qgroup is called a tracking qgroup. It is only there
in case a snapshot is needed.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>USE
CASES</b> <br>
Below are some usecases that do not mean to be extensive.
You can find your own way how to integrate
qgroups.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b><big>SINGLE-USER
MACHINE</big></b></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><b>Replacement for
partitions</b></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>The
simplest use case is to use qgroups as simple replacement
for partitions. Btrfs takes the disk as a whole, and /,
/usr, /var, etc. are created as subvolumes. As each
subvolume gets it own qgroup automatically, they can simply
be restricted. No hierarchy is needed for that.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>Track
usage of snapshots</b></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>When a
snapshot is taken, a qgroup for it will automatically be
created with the correct values. <i>Referenced</i> will show
how much is in it, possibly shared with other subvolumes.
<i>Exclusive</i> will be the amount of space that gets freed
when the subvolume is deleted.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b><big>MULTI-USER
MACHINE</big></b></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><big><b>Restricting
homes</b></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>When you
have several users on a machine, with home directories
probably under /home, you might want to restrict /home as a
whole, while restricting every user to an individual limit
as well. This is easily accomplished by creating a qgroup
for /home , eg. 1/1, and assigning all user subvolumes to
it. Restricting this qgroup will limit /home, while every
user subvolume can get its own (lower) limit.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>Accounting
snapshots to the user</b></big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>Let&rsquo;s
say the user is allowed to create snapshots via some
mechanism. It would only be fair to account space used by
the snapshots to the user. This does not mean the user
doubles his usage as soon as he takes a snapshot. Of course,
files that are present in his home and the snapshot should
only be accounted once. This can be accomplished by creating
a qgroup for each user, say <i>1/UID</i>. The user home and
all snapshots are assigned to this qgroup. Limiting it will
extend the limit to all snapshots, counting files only once.
To limit /home as a whole, a higher level group 2/1
replacing 1/1 from the previous example is needed, with all
user qgroups assigned to it.</big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>Do not
account snapshots</b></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>On the
other hand, when the snapshots get created automatically,
the user has no chance to control them, so the space used by
them should not be accounted to him. This is already the
case when creating snapshots in the example from the
previous section.</big></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big><b>Snapshots
for backup purposes</b></big></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><big>This
scenario is a mixture of the previous two. The user can
create snapshots, but some snapshots for backup purposes are
being created by the system. The user&rsquo;s snapshots
should be accounted to the user, not the system. The
solution is similar to the one from section <i>Accounting
snapshots to the user</i>, but do not assign system
snapshots to user&rsquo;s qgroup.</big></p>
