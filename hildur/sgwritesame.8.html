<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Send the SCSI
WRITE SAME (10, 16 or 32 byte) command to <i>DEVICE</i>.
This command writes the given block <i>NUM</i> times to
consecutive blocks on the <i>DEVICE</i> starting at logical
block address <i>LBA</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The length of
the block to be written multiple times is obtained from
either the <i>LEN</i> argument, or the length of the given
input file <i>IF</i>, or by calling READ CAPACITY(16) on
<i>DEVICE</i>. The contents of the block to be written are
obtained from the input file <i>IF</i> or zeros are used. If
READ CAPACITY(16) is called (which implies <i>IF</i> was not
given) and the PROT_EN bit is set then an extra 8 bytes
(i.e. more than the logical block size) of 0xff are sent. If
READ CAPACITY(16) fails then READ CAPACITY(10) is used to
determine the block size.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If neither
<i>--10</i>, <i>--16</i> nor <i>--32</i> is given then WRITE
SAME(10) is sent unless one of the following conditions is
met. If <i>LBA</i> (plus <i>NUM</i>) exceeds 32 bits,
<i>NUM</i> exceeds 65535, or the <i>--unmap</i> option is
given then WRITE SAME(16) is sent. The <i>--10</i>,
<i>--16</i> and <i>--32</i> options are mutually
exclusive.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SBC-3 revision
35d introduced a &quot;No Data-Out Buffer&quot; (NDOB) bit
which, if set, bypasses the requirement to send a single
block of data to the <i>DEVICE</i> together with the
command. Only WRITE SAME (16 and 32 byte) support the NDOB
bit. If given, a user block of zeros is assumed; if
required, protection information of 0xffs is assumed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In SBC-3
revision 26 the UNMAP and ANCHOR bits were added to the
WRITE SAME (10) command. Since the UNMAP bit has been in
WRITE SAME (16) and WRITE SAME (32) since SBC-3 revision 18,
the lower of the two (i.e. WRITE SAME (16)) is the default
when the <i>--unmap</i> option is given. To send WRITE SAME
(10) use the <i>--10</i> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Take
care:</b> The WRITE SAME(10, 16 and 32) commands may
interpret a <i>NUM</i> of zero as write to the end of
<i>DEVICE</i>. This utility defaults <i>NUM</i> to 1 . The
WRITE SAME commands have no IMMED bit so if <i>NUM</i> is
large (or zero) then an invocation of this utility could
take a long time, potentially as long as a FORMAT UNIT
command. In such situations the command timeout value
<i>TO</i> may need to be increased from its default value of
60 seconds. In SBC-3 revision 26 the WSNZ (write same no
zero) bit was added to the Block Limits VPD page [0xB0]. If
set the WRITE SAME commands will not accept a <i>NUM</i> of
zero. The same SBC-3 revision added the &quot;Maximum Write
Same Length&quot; field to the Block Limits VPD page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The Logical
Block Provisioning VPD page [0xB2] contains the LBPWS and
LBPWS10 bits. If LBPWS is set then WRITE SAME (16) supports
the UNMAP bit. If LBPWS10 is set then WRITE SAME (10)
supports the UNMAP bit. If either LBPWS or LBPWS10 is set
and the WRITE SAME (32) is supported then WRITE SAME (32)
supports the UNMAP bit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a precaution
against an accidental &rsquo;sg_write_same /dev/sda&rsquo;
(for example) overwriting LBA 0 on /dev/sda with zeros, at
least one of the <i>--in=IF</i>, <i>--lba=LBA</i> or
<i>--num=NUM</i> options must be given. Obviously this
utility can destroy a lot of user data so check the options
carefully.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Arguments to
long options are mandatory for short options as well. The
options are arranged in alphabetical order based on the long
option name. <b><br>
-R</b>, <b>--10</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">send a SCSI WRITE SAME (10)
command to <i>DEVICE</i>. The ability to set the
<i>--unmap</i> (and <i>--anchor</i>) options to this command
was added in SBC-3 revision 26.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-S</b>, <b>--16</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">send a SCSI WRITE SAME (16)
command to <i>DEVICE</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-T</b>, <b>--32</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">send a SCSI WRITE SAME (32)
command to <i>DEVICE</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-a</b>, <b>--anchor</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the ANCHOR bit in the cdb.
Introduced in SBC-3 revision 22. That draft requires the
<i>--unmap</i> option to also be specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-g</b>,
<b>--grpnum</b>=<i>GN</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the &rsquo;Group
number&rsquo; field to <i>GN</i>. Defaults to a value of
zero. <i>GN</i> should be a value between 0 and 63.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">output the usage message then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-i</b>,
<b>--in</b>=<i>IF</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">read data (binary) from file
named <i>IF</i> and use it as the data-out buffer for the
SCSI WRITE SAME command. The length of the data-out buffer
is <i>--xferlen=LEN</i> or, if that is not given, the length
of the <i>IF</i> file. If <i>IF</i> is &quot;-&quot; then
stdin is read. If this option is not given then 0x00 bytes
are used as fill with the length of the data-out buffer
obtained from <i>--xferlen=LEN</i> or by calling READ
CAPACITY(16 or 10). If the response to READ CAPACITY(16) has
the PROT_EN bit set then data- out buffer size is modified
accordingly with the last 8 bytes set to 0xff.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-l</b>,
<b>--lba</b>=<i>LBA</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where <i>LBA</i> is the logical
block address to start the WRITE SAME command. Defaults to
lba 0 which is a dangerous block to overwrite on a disk that
is in use. Assumed to be in decimal unless prefixed with
&rsquo;0x&rsquo; or has a trailing &rsquo;h&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-L</b>, <b>--lbdata</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the LBDATA bit in the
WRITE SAME cdb. This bit was made obsolete in sbc3r32 in
September 2012.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-N</b>, <b>--ndob</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the NDOB bit in the WRITE
SAME (16 and 32 byte) commands. NDOB stands for No Data-Out
Buffer. Default is to clear this bit. When this option is
given then <i>--in=IF</i> is not allowed and
<i>--xferlen=LEN</i> can only be given if <i>LEN</i> is 0
.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-n</b>,
<b>--num</b>=<i>NUM</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where <i>NUM</i> is the number
of blocks, starting at <i>LBA</i>, to write the data-out
buffer to. The default value for <i>NUM</i> is 1. The value
corresponds to the &rsquo;Number of logical blocks&rsquo;
field in the WRITE SAME cdb. <br>
Note that a value of 0 in <i>NUM</i> may be interpreted as
write the data-out buffer on every block starting at
<i>LBA</i> to the end of the <i>DEVICE</i>. If the WSNZ bit
(introduced in sbc3r26, January 2011) in the Block Limits
VPD page is set then the value of 0 is disallowed, yielding
an Invalid request sense key.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-P</b>, <b>--pbdata</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the PBDATA bit in the
WRITE SAME cdb. This bit was made obsolete in sbc3r32 in
September 2012.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-t</b>,
<b>--timeout</b>=<i>TO</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where <i>TO</i> is the command
timeout value in seconds. The default value is 60 seconds.
If <i>NUM</i> is large (or zero) a WRITE SAME command may
require considerably more time than 60 seconds to
complete.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-U</b>, <b>--unmap</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the UNMAP bit in the WRITE
SAME(10, 16 and 32) cdb. See UNMAP section below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">increase the degree of
verbosity (debug messages).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">output version string then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-w</b>,
<b>--wrprotect</b>=<i>WPR</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the &quot;Write
protect&quot; field in the WRITE SAME cdb to <i>WPR</i>. The
default value is zero. <i>WPR</i> should be a value between
0 and 7. When <i>WPR</i> is 1 or greater, and the
disk&rsquo;s protection type is 1 or greater, then 8 extra
bytes of protection information are expected or generated
(to place in the command&rsquo;s data-out buffer).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-x</b>,
<b>--xferlen</b>=<i>LEN</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where <i>LEN</i> is the
data-out buffer length. Defaults to the length of the
<i>IF</i> file or, if that is not given, then the READ
CAPACITY(16 or 10) command is used to find the
&rsquo;Logical block length in bytes&rsquo;. That figure may
be increased by 8 bytes if the <i>DEVICE</i>&rsquo;s
protection type is 1 or greater and the WRPROTECT field (see
<i>--wrprotect=WPR</i>) is 1 or greater. If both this option
and the <i>IF</i> option are given and <i>LEN</i> exceeds
the length of the <i>IF</i> file then <i>LEN</i> is the
data-out buffer length with zeros used as pad bytes.</p>

<h2>UNMAP
<a name="UNMAP"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Logical block
provisioning is a new term introduced in SBC-3 revision 25
for the ability to mark blocks as unused. For large storage
arrays, it is a way to provision less physical storage than
the READ CAPACITY command reports is available, potentially
allocating more physical storage when WRITE commands require
it. For flash memory (e.g. SSD drives) it is a way of
potentially saving power (and perhaps access time) when it
is known large sections (or almost all) of the flash memory
is not in use. SSDs need wear levelling algorithms to have
acceptable endurance and typically over provision to
simplify those algorithms; hence they typically contain more
physical flash storage than their logical size would
dictate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
logical block provisioning is indicated by the LBPME bit
being set in the READ CAPACITY(16) command response (see the
sg_readcap utility). That implies at least one of the UNMAP
or WRITE SAME(16) commands is implemented. If the UNMAP
command is implemented then the &quot;Maximum unmap LBA
count&quot; and &quot;Maximum unmap block descriptor
count&quot; fields in the Block Limits VPD page should both
be greater than zero. The READ CAPACITY(16) command response
also contains a LBPRZ bit which if set means that if
unmapped blocks are read then zeros will be returned for the
data (and if protection information is active, 0xff bytes
are returned for that). In SBC-3 revision 27 the same LBPRZ
bit was added to the Logical Block Provisioning VPD
page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In SBC-3
revision 25 the LBPU and ANC_SUP bits where added to the
Logical Block Provisioning VPD page. When LBPU is set it
indicates that the device supports the UNMAP command (see
the sg_unmap utility). When the ANC_SUP bit is set it
indicates the device supports anchored LBAs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When the UNMAP
bit is set in the cdb then the data-out buffer is also sent.
Additionally the data section of that data-out buffer should
be full of 0x0 bytes while the data protection block, 8
bytes at the end if present, should be set to 0xff bytes. If
these conditions are not met and the LBPRZ bit is set then
the UNMAP bit is ignored and the data-out buffer is written
to the <i>DEVICE</i> as if the UNMAP bit was zero. In the
absence of the <i>--in=IF</i> option, this utility will
attempt build a data-out buffer that meets the requirements
for the UNMAP bit in the cdb to be acted on by the
<i>DEVICE</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Logical blocks
may also be unmapped by the SCSI UNMAP and FORMAT UNIT
commands (see the sg_unmap and sg_format utilities).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The unmap
capability in SCSI is closely related to the ATA DATA SET
MANAGEMENT command with the &quot;Trim&quot; bit set. That
ATA trim capability does not interact well with SATA command
queueing known as NCQ. T13 have introduced a new command
called the SFQ DATA SET MANAGEMENT command also with a the
&quot;Trim&quot; bit to address that problem. The SCSI WRITE
SAME with the UNMAP bit set and the UNMAP commands do not
have any problems with SCSI queueing.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Various numeric
arguments (e.g. <i>LBA</i>) may include multiplicative
suffixes or be given in hexadecimal. See the &quot;NUMERIC
ARGUMENTS&quot; section in the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Linux, prior
to lk 3.17, the sg driver did not support cdb sizes greater
than 16 bytes. Hence a device node like /dev/sg1 which is
associated with the sg driver would fail with this utility
if the <i>--32</i> option was given (or implied by other
options). The bsg driver with device nodes like
/dev/bsg/6:0:0:1 does support cdb sizes greater than 16
bytes since its introduction in lk 2.6.28 .</p>

<h2>EXIT STATUS
<a name="EXIT STATUS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exit status
of sg_write_same is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see
the sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One simple
usage is to write blocks of zero from (and including) a
given LBA:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sg_write_same
--lba=0x1234 --num=63 /dev/sdc</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Since
<i>--xferlen=LEN</i> has not been given, then this utility
will call the READ CAPACITY command on /dev/sdc to determine
the number of bytes in a logical block. Let us assume that
is 512 bytes. Since <i>--in=IF</i> is not given a block of
zeros is assumed. So 63 blocks of zeros (each block
containing 512 bytes) will be written from (and including)
LBA 0x1234 . Note that only one block of zeros is passed to
the SCSI WRITE SAME command in the data-out buffer (as
required by SBC-3).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A similar
example follows but in this case the blocks are
&quot;unmapped&quot; (&quot;trimmed&quot; in ATA speak)
rather than zeroed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sg_write_same
--unmap -L 0x1234 -n 63 /dev/sdc</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
the LBPRZ bit in the READ CAPACITY(16) response is set (i.e.
LPPRZ is an acronym for logical block provisioning read
zeros) then these two examples do the same thing, at least
seen from the point of view of subsequent reads.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This utility
can also be used to write protection information (PI) on
disks formatted with a protection type greater than zero. PI
is 8 bytes of extra data appended to the user data of a
logical block: the first two bytes are a CRC (the
&quot;guard&quot;), the next two bytes are the
&quot;application tag&quot; and the last four bytes are the
&quot;reference tag&quot;. With protection types 1 and 2 if
the application tag is 0xffff then the guard should not be
checked (against the user data).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this example
we assume the logical block size (of the user data) is 512
bytes and the disk has been formatted with protection type
1. Since we are going to modify LBA 2468 then we take a copy
of it first:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dd if=/dev/sdb
skip=2468 bs=512 of=2468.bin count=1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
command line sets the user data to zeros and the PI to 8
0xFF bytes on LBA 2468:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sg_write_same
--lba=2468 /dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Reading back
that block should be successful because the application tag
is 0xffff which suppresses the guard (CRC) check (which
would otherwise be wrong):</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dd if=/dev/sdb
skip=2468 bs=512 of=/dev/null count=1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Now an attempt
is made to create a binary file with zeros in the user data,
0x0000 in the application tag and 0xff bytes in the other
two PI fields. It is awkward to create 0xff bytes in a file
(in Unix) as the &quot;tr&quot; command below shows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dd if=/dev/zero
bs=1 count=512 of=ud.bin <br>
tr &quot;\000&quot; &quot;\377&quot; &lt; /dev/zero | dd
bs=1 of=ff_s.bin count=8 <br>
cat ud.bin ff_s.bin &gt; lb.bin <br>
dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=2 seek=514 conv=notrunc
of=lb.bin</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The resulting
file can be viewed with &rsquo;hexdump -C lb.bin&rsquo; and
should contain 520 bytes. Now that file can be written to
LBA 2468 as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sg_write_same
--lba=2468 wrprotect=3 --in=lb.bin /dev/sdb</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note the
<i>--wrprotect=3</i> rather than being set to 1, since we
want the WRITE SAME command to succeed even though the PI
data now indicates the user data is corrupted. When an
attempt is made to read the LBA, an error should occur:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dd if=/dev/sdb
skip=2468 bs=512 of=/dev/null count=1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dd errors are
not very expressive, if dmesg is checked there should be a
line something like this: &quot;[sdb] Add. Sense: Logical
block guard check failed&quot;. The block can be corrected
by doing a &quot;sg_write_same --lba=1234 /dev/sdb&quot;
again or restoring the original contents of that LBA:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">dd if=2468.bin
bs=512 seek=2468 of=/dev/sdb conv=notrunc count=1</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Hopefully the
dd command would never try to truncate the output file when
it is a block device.</p>
