Recover updates committed by Windows on an NTFS volume</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ntfsrecover</b>
[<i>options</i>] <i>device</i></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i><b>ntfsrecover</b></i>
applies to the metadata the updates which were requested on
Windows but could not be completed because they were
interrupted by some event such as a power failure, a
hardware crash, a software crash or the device being
unplugged. Doing so, the file system is restored to a
consistent state, however updates to user data may still be
lost.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Updating the
file system generally requires updating several records
which should all be made for the file system to be kept
consistent. For instance, creating a new file requires
reserving an inode number (set a bit in a bit map), creating
a file record (store the file name and file attributes), and
registering the file in a directory (locate the file from
some path). When an unfortunate event occurs, and one of
these updates could be done but not all of them, the file
system is left inconsistent.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A group of
updates which have all to be done to preserve consistency is
called a transaction, and the end of updates within a
transaction is called the commitment of the transaction.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To protect from
unfortunate events, Windows first logs in a special file all
the metadata update requests without applying any, until the
commitment is known. If the event occurs before the
commitment, no update has been made and the file system is
consistent. If the event occurs after the update, the log
file can be analyzed later and the transactions which were
committed can be executed again, thus restoring the
integrity of the file system.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>ntfsrecover</b>
similarly examines the log file and applies the updates
within committed transactions which could not be done by
Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Currently,
ntfs-3g does not log updates, so <b>ntfsrecover</b> cannot
be used to restore consistency after an unfortunate event
occurred while the file system was updated by Linux.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Below is a
summary of all the options that <b>ntfsrecover</b> accepts.
The normal usage is to use no option at all, as most of
these options are oriented towards developers needs.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Nearly all
options have two equivalent names. The short name is
preceded by <b>-</b> and the long name is preceded by
<b>--</b>. Any single letter options, that don&rsquo;t take
an argument, can be combined into a single command, e.g.
<b>-bv</b> is equivalent to <b>-b -v</b>. Long named options
can be abbreviated to any unique prefix of their name.
<b><br>
-b</b>, <b>--backward</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Examine the actions described
in the logfile backward from the latest one to the earliest
one without applying any update. This may encompass records
generated during several sessions, and when Windows is
restarted, it often does not restart writing where it ended
the previous session, so this leads to errors and bad
sequencing when examining the full log file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-c</b>, <b>--clusters
CLUSTER-RANGE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Restrict the output generated
when using options -b -f -u -p to the actions operating on a
cluster within the given cluster range. CLUSTER-RANGE is
defined by the first and last cluster numbers separated by a
hyphen, for instance 100-109 or 0x3e8-0x3ff. A single number
means restricting to a single cluster. The first four log
blocks have a special role and they are always shown.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-f</b>, <b>--forward
NUM</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Examine the actions described
in the logfile forward from the first one to the last one
without applying any update. As the log file is reused
circularly, the first one is generally not the earliest.
Moreover when Windows is restarted, it often does not
restart writing where it ended the previous sessions, and
this leads to errors when examining a log file generated
during several sessions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Show some help information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-k</b>,
<b>--kill-fast-restart</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When Windows has been
interrupted with fast restart mode activated, part of
pending changes are kept in the Windows cache and only the
same Windows version can recover them. This option can be
used to apply the changes recorded in the log file and drop
the ones in the Windows cache. This is dangerous and may
cause loss of data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-n</b>,
<b>--no-action</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Do not apply any modification,
useful when using the options -p, -s or -u.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-p</b>, <b>--play
COUNT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Undo COUNT transaction sets and
redo a single one, a transaction set being all transactions
between two consecutive checkpoints. This is useful for
replaying some transaction in the past. As a few actions are
not undoable, this is not always possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-r</b>, <b>--range
BLOCK-RANGE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Examine the actions described
in the logfile forward restricted to the requested log file
block range without applying any update. The first four log
blocks have a special role and they are always examined.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-s</b>, <b>--sync</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sync the file system by
applying the committed actions which have not been synced
previously. This is the default option, used when none of
the options -n, -f, -r, -p and -u are present.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The option -s
can be repeated to request applying the committed actions
mentioned in the obsolete restart page. This is useful for
testing the situations where the latest restart page cannot
be read though it can actually be read.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-t</b>, <b>--transactions
COUNT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Display the transaction
parameters when examining the log file with one of the
options --forward, --backward or --range.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-u</b>, <b>--undo
COUNT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Undo COUNT transaction sets,
thus resetting the file system to some checkpoint in the
past, a transaction set being all transactions between two
consecutive checkpoints. As a few actions are not undoable,
this is not always possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Display more
debug/warning/error messages. This option may be used twice
to display even more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Show the version number,
copyright and license of <b>ntfsrecover</b>.</p>
