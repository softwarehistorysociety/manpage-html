<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sg3_utils is a
package of utilities that send SCSI commands to the given
<i>DEVICE</i> via a SCSI pass through interface provided by
the host operating system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The names of
all utilities start with &quot;sg&quot; and most start with
&quot;sg_&quot; often followed by the name, or a shortening
of the name, of the SCSI command that they send. For example
the &quot;sg_verify&quot; utility sends the SCSI VERIFY
command. A mapping between SCSI commands and the sg3_utils
utilities that issue them is shown in the COVERAGE file. The
sg_raw utility can be used to send an arbitrary SCSI command
(supplied on the command line) to the given
<i>DEVICE</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">sg_decode_sense
can be used to decode SCSI sense data given on the command
line or in a file. sg_raw -vvv will output the T10 name of a
given SCSI CDB which is most often 16 bytes or less in
length.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCSI draft
standards can be found at http://www.t10.org . The standards
themselves can be purchased from ANSI and other standards
organizations. A good overview of various SCSI standards can
be seen in http://www.t10.org/scsi-3.htm with the SCSI
command sets in the upper part of the diagram. The highest
level (i.e. most abstract) document is the SCSI Architecture
Model (SAM) with SAM-5 being the most recent standard (ANSI
INCITS 515-2016) with the most recent draft being SAM-6
revision 4 . SCSI commands in common with all device types
can be found in SCSI Primary Commands (SPC) of which SPC-4
is the most recent standard (ANSI INCITS 513-2015). The most
recent SPC draft is SPC-5 revision 19. Block device specific
commands (e.g. as used by disks) are in SBC, those for tape
drives in SSC, those for SCSI enclosures in SES and those
for CD/DVD/BD drives in MMC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is becoming
more common to control ATA disks with the SCSI command set.
This involves the translation of SCSI commands to their
corresponding ATA equivalents (and that is an imperfect
mapping in some cases). The relevant standard is called SCSI
to ATA Translation (SAT, SAT-2 and SAT-3) are now standards
at INCITS(ANSI) and ISO while SAT-4 is at the draft stage.
The logic to perform the command translation is often called
a SAT Layer or SATL and may be within an operating system,
in host bus adapter firmware or in an external device (e.g.
associated with a SAS expander). See http://www.t10.org for
more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is some
support for SCSI tape devices but not for their basic
operation. The reader is referred to the &quot;mt&quot;
utility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
generations of command line option usage. The newer
utilities (written since July 2004) use the getopt_long()
function to parse command line options. With that function,
each option has two representations: a short form (e.g.
&rsquo;-v&rsquo;) and a longer form (e.g.
&rsquo;--verbose&rsquo;). If an argument is required then it
follows a space (optionally) in the short form and a
&quot;=&quot; in the longer form (e.g. in the sg_verify
utility &rsquo;-l 2a6h&rsquo; and &rsquo;--lba=2a6h&rsquo;
are equivalent). Note that with getopt_long(), short form
options can be elided, for example: &rsquo;-all&rsquo; is
equivalent to &rsquo;-a -l -l&rsquo;. The <i>DEVICE</i>
argument may appear after, between or prior to any
options.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The older
utilities, including as sg_inq, sg_logs, sg_modes,
sg_opcode, sg_rbuff, sg_readcap, sg_senddiag, sg_start and
sg_turs had individual command line processing code
typically based on a single &quot;-&quot; followed by one or
more characters. If an argument is needed then it follows a
&quot;=&quot; ( e.g. &rsquo;-p=1f&rsquo; in sg_modes with
its older interface). Various options can be elided as long
as it is not ambiguous (e.g. &rsquo;-vv&rsquo; to increase
the verbosity).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Over time the
command line interface of these older utilities became messy
and overloaded with options. So in sg3_utils version 1.23
the command line interface of these older utilities was
altered to have both a cleaner getopt_long() interface and
their older interface for backward compatibility. By default
these older utilities use their getopt_long() based
interface. The getopt_long() is a GNU extension (i.e. not
yet POSIX certified) but more recent command line utilities
tend to use it. That can be overridden by defining the
SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable or using
&rsquo;-O&rsquo; or &rsquo;--old&rsquo; as the first command
line option. The man pages of the older utilities documents
the details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several
sg3_utils utilities are based on the Unix dd command (e.g.
sg_dd) and permit copying data at the level of SCSI READ and
WRITE commands. sg_dd is tightly bound to Linux and hence is
not ported to other OSes. A more generic utility (than
sg_dd) called ddpt in a package of the same name has been
ported to other OSes.</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
<a name="ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
SG3_UTILS_OLD_OPTS environment variable is explained in the
previous section. It is only for backward compatibility of
the command line options for older utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
SG3_UTILS_DSENSE environment variable may be set to a
number. If that number is non-zero then descriptor sense is
set in the SNTL (the small SCSI to NVMe Translation Layer
within the underlying library).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several
utilities have their own environment variable setting (e.g.
sg_persist has SG_PERSIST_IN_RDONLY). See individual utility
man pages for more information.</p>

<h2>LINUX DEVICE NAMING
<a name="LINUX DEVICE NAMING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Most disk block
devices have names like /dev/sda, /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc, etc.
SCSI disks in Linux have always had names like that but in
recent Linux kernels it has become more common for many
other disks (including SATA disks and USB storage devices)
to be named like that. Partitions within a disk are
specified by a number appended to the device name, starting
at 1 (e.g. /dev/sda1 ).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tape drives are
named /dev/st&lt;num&gt; or /dev/nst&lt;num&gt; where
&lt;num&gt; starts at zero. Additionally one letter from
this list: &quot;lma&quot; may be appended to the name. CD,
DVD and BD readers (and writers) are named
/dev/sr&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; start at zero. There
are less used SCSI device type names, the dmesg and the
lsscsi commands may help to find if any are attached to a
running system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is also a
SCSI device driver which offers alternate generic access to
SCSI devices. It uses names of the form /dev/sg&lt;num&gt;
where &lt;num&gt; starts at zero. The &quot;lsscsi -g&quot;
command may be useful in finding these and which generic
name corresponds to a device type name (e.g. /dev/sg2 may
correspond to /dev/sda). In the lk 2.6 series a block SCSI
generic driver was introduced and its names are of the form
/dev/bsg/&lt;h:c:t:l&gt; where h, c, t and l are numbers.
Again see the lsscsi command to find the correspondence
between that SCSI tuple (i.e. &lt;h:c:t:l&gt;) and alternate
device names.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Prior to the
Linux kernel 2.6 series these utilities could only use
generic device names (e.g. /dev/sg1 ). In almost all cases
in the Linux kernel 2.6 series, any device name can be used
by these utilities.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Very little has
changed in Linux device naming in the Linux kernel 3 and 4
series.</p>

<h2>WINDOWS DEVICE NAMING
<a name="WINDOWS DEVICE NAMING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Storage and
related devices can have several device names in Windows.
Probably the most common in the volume name (e.g.
&quot;D:&quot;). There are also a &quot;class&quot; device
names such as &quot;PhysicalDrive&lt;n&gt;&quot;,
&quot;CDROM&lt;n&gt;&quot; and &quot;TAPE&lt;n&gt;&quot;.
&lt;n&gt; is an integer starting at 0 allocated in ascending
order as devices are discovered (and sometimes
rediscovered).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some storage
devices have a SCSI lower level device name which starts
with a SCSI (pseudo) adapter name of the form
&quot;SCSI&lt;n&gt;:&quot;. To this is added sub-addressing
in the form of a &quot;bus&quot; number, a
&quot;target&quot; identifier and a LUN (Logical Unit
Number). The &quot;bus&quot; number is also known as a
&quot;PathId&quot;. These are assembled to form a device
name of the form:
&quot;SCSI&lt;n&gt;:&lt;bus&gt;,&lt;target&gt;,&lt;lun&gt;&quot;.
The trailing &quot;,&lt;lun&gt;&quot; may be omitted in
which case a LUN of zero is assumed. This lower level device
name cannot often be used directly since Windows blocks
attempts to use it if a class driver has &quot;claimed&quot;
the device. There are SCSI device types (e.g.
Automation/Drive interface type) for which there is no class
driver. At least two transports (&quot;bus types&quot; in
Windows jargon): USB and IEEE 1394 do not have a
&quot;scsi&quot; device names of this form.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In keeping with
DOS file system conventions, the various device names can be
given in upper, lower or mixed case. Since
&quot;PhysicalDrive&lt;n&gt;&quot; is tedious to write, a
shortened form of &quot;PD&lt;n&gt;&quot; is permitted by
all utilities in this package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A single device
(e.g. a disk) can have many device names. For example:
&quot;PD0&quot; can also be &quot;C:&quot;, &quot;D:&quot;
and &quot;SCSI0:0,1,0&quot;. The two volume names reflect
that the disk has two partitions on it. Disk partitions that
are not recognized by Windows are not usually given a volume
name. However Vista does show a volume name for a disk which
has no partitions recognized by it and when selected invites
the user to format it (which may be rather unfriendly to
other OSes).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These utilities
assume a given device name is in the Win32 device namespace.
To make that explicit &quot;\\.\&quot; can be prepended to
the device names mentioned in this section. Beware that
backslash is an escape character in Unix like shells and the
C programming language. In a shell like Msys (from MinGW)
each backslash may need to be typed twice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sg_scan
utility within this package lists out Windows device names
in a form that is suitable for other utilities in this
package to use.</p>

<h2>FREEBSD DEVICE NAMING
<a name="FREEBSD DEVICE NAMING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCSI disks have
block names of the form /dev/da&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt;
is an integer starting at zero. The &quot;da&quot; is
replaced by &quot;sa&quot; for SCSI tape drives and
&quot;cd&quot; for SCSI CD/DVD/BD drives. Each SCSI device
has a corresponding pass-through device name of the form
/dev/pass&lt;num&gt; where &lt;num&gt; is an integer
starting at zero. The &quot;camcontrol devlist&quot; command
may be useful for finding out which SCSI device names are
available and the correspondence between class and
pass-through names.</p>

<h2>SOLARIS DEVICE NAMING
<a name="SOLARIS DEVICE NAMING"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">SCSI device
names below the /dev directory have a form like: c5t4d3s2
where the number following &quot;c&quot; is the controller
(HBA) number, the number following &quot;t&quot; is the
target number (from the SCSI parallel interface days) and
the number following &quot;d&quot; is the LUN. Following the
&quot;s&quot; is the slice number which is related to a
partition and by convention &quot;s2&quot; is the whole
disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">OpenSolaris
also has a c5t4d3p2 form where the number following the
&quot;p&quot; is the partition number apart from
&quot;p0&quot; which is the whole disk. So a whole disk may
be referred to as either c5t4d3, c5t4d3s2 or c5t4d3p0 .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">And these
device names are duplicated in the /dev/dsk and /dev/rdsk
directories. The former is the block device name and the
latter is for &quot;raw&quot; (or char device) access which
is what sg3_utils needs. So in OpenSolaris something of the
form &rsquo;sg_inq /dev/rdsk/c5t4d3p0&rsquo; should work. If
it doesn&rsquo;t work then add a &rsquo;-vvv&rsquo; option
for more debug information. Trying this form &rsquo;sg_inq
/dev/dsk/c5t4d3p0&rsquo; (note &quot;rdsk&quot; changed to
&quot;dsk&quot;) will result in an &quot;inappropriate ioctl
for device&quot; error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The device
names within the /dev directory are typically symbolic links
to much longer topological names in the /device directory.
In Solaris cd/dvd/bd drives seem to be treated as disks and
so are found in the /dev/rdsk directory. Tape drives appear
in the /dev/rmt directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is also a
sgen (SCSI generic) driver which by default does not attach
to any device. See the /kernel/drv/sgen.conf file to control
what is attached. Any attached device will have a device
name of the form /dev/scsi/c5t4d3 .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Listing
available SCSI devices in Solaris seems to be a challenge.
&quot;Use the &rsquo;format&rsquo; command&quot; advice
works but seems a very dangerous way to list devices. [It
does prompt again before doing any damage.] &rsquo;devfsadm
-Cv&rsquo; cleans out the clutter in the /dev/rdsk
directory, only leaving what is &quot;live&quot;. The
&quot;cfgadm -v&quot; command looks promising.</p>

<h2>NVME SUPPORT
<a name="NVME SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">NVMe (or NVM
Express) is a relatively new storage transport and command
set. The level of abstraction of the NVMe command set is
somewhat lower the SCSI command sets, closer to the level of
abstraction of ATA (and SATA) command sets. NVMe claims to
be designed with flash and modern &quot;solid state&quot;
storage in mind, something unheard of when SCSI was
originally developed in the 1980s.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SCSI
command sets&rsquo; advantage is the length of time they
have been in place and the existing tools (like these) to
support it. Plus SCSI command sets level of abstraction is
both and advantage and disadvantage. Recently the NVME-MI
(Management Interface) designers decide to use the SCSI
Enclosure Services (SES-3) standard &quot;as is&quot; with
the addition of two tunnelling NVME-MI commands: SES Send
and SES Receive. This means after the OS interface
differences are taken into account, the sg_ses,
sg_ses_microcode and sg_senddiag utilities can be used on a
NVMe device that supports a newer version of NVME-MI.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The NVME-MI SES
Send and SES Receive commands correspond to the SCSI SEND
DIAGNOSTIC and RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS commands
respectively. There are however a few other commands that
need to be translated, the most important of which is the
SCSI INQUIRY command to the NVMe Identify
controller/namespace. Version 1.43 of these utilities
contain a small SNTL (SCSI to NVMe Translation Layer) to
take care of these details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a side
effect of this &quot;juggling&quot; if the sg_inq utility is
used (without the --page= option) on a NVMe <i>DEVICE</i>
then the actual NVMe Identifier (controller and possibly
namespace) responses are decoded and output. However if
&rsquo;sg_inq --page=sinq &lt;device&gt;&rsquo; is given for
the same <i>DEVICE</i> then parts of the NVMe Identify
controller and namespace response are translated to a SCSI
standard INQUIRY response which is then decoded and
output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Apart from the
special case with the sg_inq, all other utilities in the
package assume they are talking to a SCSI device and decode
any response accordingly. One easy way for users to see the
underlying device is a NVMe device is the standard INQUIRY
response Vendor Identification field of &quot;NVMe &quot;
(an 8 character long string with 4 spaces to the right).</p>

<h2>EXIT STATUS
<a name="EXIT STATUS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To aid scripts
that call these utilities, the exit status is set to
indicate success (0) or failure (1 or more). Note that some
of the lower values correspond to the SCSI sense key
values.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exit status
values listed below can be given to the sg_decode_sense
utility (which is found in this package) as follows: <br>
sg_decode_sense --err=&lt;exit_status&gt; <br>
and a short explanatory string will be output to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exit status
values are:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

return a small integer number to help indicate what the
error is. For example in Unix the inability of a system call
to allocate memory returns (in &rsquo;errno&rsquo;) ENOMEM
which often is associated with the integer 12. So 62 (i.e.
&rsquo;50 + 12&rsquo;) may be returned by a utility in this
case. It is also possible that a utility in this package
reports 50+ENOMEM when it can&rsquo;t allocate memory, not
necessarily from an OS system call. In recent versions of
Linux the file showing the mapping between symbolic
constants (e.g. ENOMEM) and the corresponding integer is in
the kernel source code file:
include/uapi/asm-generic/errno-base.h <br>
Note that errno values that are greater than or equal to 47
cannot fit in range provided. Instead they are all mapped to

<h2>COMMON OPTIONS
<a name="COMMON OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Arguments to
long options are mandatory for short options as well. In the
short form an argument to an option uses zero or more spaces
as a separator (i.e. the short form does not use
&quot;=&quot; as a separator).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an option
takes a numeric argument then that argument is assumed to be
decimal unless otherwise indicated (e.g. with a leading
&quot;0x&quot;, a trailing &quot;h&quot; or as noted in the
usage message).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some options
are used uniformly in most of the utilities in this package.
Those options are listed below. Note that there are some
exceptions. <b><br>
-d</b>, <b>--dry-run</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">utilities that can cause lots
of user data to be lost or overwritten sometimes have a
<i>--dry-run</i> option. Device modifying actions are
typically bypassed (or skipped) to implement a policy of
&quot;do no harm&quot;. This allows complex command line
invocations to be tested before the action required (e.g.
format a disk) is performed. The <i>--dry-run</i> option has
become a common feature of many command line utilities (e.g.
the Unix &rsquo;patch&rsquo; command), not just those from
this package. <br>
Note that most hyphenated option names in this package also
can be given with an underscore rather than a hyphen (e.g.
<i>--dry_run</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-e</b>,
<b>--enumerate</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">some utilities (e.g. sg_ses and
sg_vpd) store a lot of information in internal tables. This
option will output that information in some readable form
(e.g. sorted by an acronym or by page number) then exit.
Note that with this option <i>DEVICE</i> is ignored (as are
most other options) and no SCSI IO takes place, so the
invoker does not need any elevated permissions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-h</b>, <b>-?</b>,
<b>--help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">output the usage message then
exit. In a few older utilities the &rsquo;-h&rsquo; option
requests hexadecimal output. In these cases the
&rsquo;-?&rsquo; option will output the usage message then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">for SCSI commands that yield a
non-trivial response, print out that response in ASCII
hexadecimal. To produce hexadecimal that can be parsed by
other utilities (e.g. without a relative address to the left
and without trailing ASCII) use this option three or four
times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-i</b>,
<b>--in</b>=<i>FN</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">many SCSI commands fetch a
significant amount of data (returned in the data-in buffer)
which several of these utilities decode (e.g. sg_vpd and
sg_logs). To separate the two steps of fetching the data
from a SCSI device and then decoding it, this option has
been added. The first step (fetching the data) can be done
using the <i>--hex</i> or <i>--raw</i> option and
redirecting the command line output to a file (often done
with &quot;&gt;&quot; in Unix based operating systems). The
difference between <i>--hex</i> and <i>--raw</i> is that the
former produces output in ASCII hexadecimal while
<i>--raw</i> produces its output in &quot;raw&quot; binary.
<br>
The second step (i.e. decoding the SCSI response data now
held in a file) can be done using this <i>--in=FN</i> option
where the file name is <i>FN</i>. If &quot;-&quot; is used
for <i>FN</i> then stdin is assumed, again this allows for
command line redirection (or piping). That file (or stdin)
is assumed to contain ASCII hexadecimal unless the
<i>--raw</i> option is also given in which case it is
assumed to be binary. Notice that the meaning of the
<i>--raw</i> option is &quot;flipped&quot; when used with
<i>--in=FN</i> to act on the input, typically it acts on the
output data. <br>
Since the structure of the data returned by SCSI commands
varies considerably then the usage information or the
manpage of the utility being used should be checked. In some
cases <i>--hex</i> may need to be used multiple times (and
is more conveniently given as &rsquo;-HH&rsquo; or
&rsquo;-HHH). In other cases the name of this option is
<i>--inhex=FN</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-m</b>,
<b>--maxlen</b>=<i>LEN</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">several important SCSI commands
(e.g. INQUIRY and MODE SENSE) have response lengths that
vary depending on many factors, only some of which these
utilities take into account. The maximum response length is
typically specified in the &rsquo;allocation length&rsquo;
field of the cdb. In the absence of this option, several
utilities use a default allocation length (sometimes
recommended in the SCSI draft standards) or a &quot;double
fetch&quot; strategy. See sg_logs(8) for its description of
a &quot;double fetch&quot; strategy. These techniques are
imperfect and in the presence of faulty SCSI targets can
cause problems (e.g. some USB mass storage devices freeze if
they receive an INQUIRY allocation length other than 36).
Also use of this option disables any &quot;double
fetch&quot; strategy that may have otherwise been used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">for SCSI commands that yield a
non-trivial response, output that response in binary to
stdout. If any error messages or warning are produced they
are usually sent to stderr so as to not interfere with the
output from this option. <br>
Some utilities that consume data to send to the
<i>DEVICE</i> along with the SCSI command, use this option.
Alternatively the <i>--in=FN</i> option causes <i>DEVICE</i>
to be ignored and the response data (to be decoded) fetched
from a file named <i>FN</i>. In these cases this option may
indicate that binary data can be read from stdin or from a
nominated file (e.g. <i>FN</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-t</b>,
<b>--timeout</b>=<i>SECS</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">utilities that issue
potentially long-running SCSI commands often have a
<i>--timeout=SECS</i> option. This typically instructs the
operating system to abort the SCSI command in question once
the timeout expires. Aborting SCSI commands is typically a
messy business and in the case of format like commands may
leave the device in a &quot;format corrupt&quot; state
requiring another long-running re-initialization command to
be sent. The argument, <i>SECS</i>, is usually in seconds
and the short form of the option may be something other than
<i>-t</i> since the timeout option was typically added later
as storage devices grew in size and initialization commands
took longer. Since many utilities had relatively long
internal command timeouts before this option was introduced,
the actual command timeout given to the operating systems is
the higher of the internal timeout and <i>SECS</i>. <br>
Many long running SCSI commands have an IMMED bit which
causes the command to finish relatively quickly but the
initialization process to continue. In such cases the
REQUEST SENSE command can be used to monitor progress with
its progress indication field (see the sg_requests and
sg_turs utilities). Utilities that send such SCSI command
either have an <i>--immed</i> option or a <i>--wait</i>
option which is the logical inverse of the
&quot;immediate&quot; action.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">increase the level of
verbosity, (i.e. debug output). Can be used multiple times
to further increase verbosity. The additional output caused
by this option is almost always sent to stderr.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">print the version string and
then exit. Each utility has its own version number and date
of last code change.</p>

<h2>NUMERIC ARGUMENTS
<a name="NUMERIC ARGUMENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Many utilities
have command line options that take numeric arguments. These
numeric arguments can be large values (e.g. a logical block
address (LBA) on a disk) and can be inconvenient to enter in
the default decimal representation. So various other
representations are permitted.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Multiplicative
suffixes are accepted. They are one, two or three letter
strings appended directly after the number to which they
apply:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">c C *1 <br>
w W *2 <br>
b B *512 <br>
k K KiB *1024 <br>
KB kB *1000 <br>
m M MiB *1048576 <br>
MB mB *1000000 <br>
g G GiB *(2^30) <br>
GB gB *(10^9) <br>
t T TiB *(2^40) <br>
TB *(10^12) <br>
p P PiB *(2^50) <br>
PB *(10^15)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An example is
&quot;2k&quot; for 2048. The large tera and peta suffixes
are only available for numeric arguments that might require
64 bits to represent internally.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A suffix of the
form &quot;x&lt;n&gt;&quot; multiplies the leading number by
&lt;n&gt;. An example is &quot;2x33&quot; for
&quot;66&quot;. The leading number cannot be &quot;0&quot;
(zero) as that would be interpreted as a hexadecimal number
(see below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
multiplicative suffixes are compatible with GNU&rsquo;s dd
command (since 2002) which claims compliance with SI and
with IEC 60027-2.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Alternatively
numerical arguments can be given in hexadecimal. There are
two syntaxes. The number can be preceded by either
&quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot; as found in the C
programming language. The second hexadecimal representation
is a trailing &quot;h&quot; or &quot;H&quot; as found in
(storage) standards. When hex numbers are given, multipliers
cannot be used. For example the decimal value
&quot;256&quot; can be given as &quot;0x100&quot; or
&quot;100h&quot;.</p>

<h2>MICROCODE AND FIRMWARE
<a name="MICROCODE AND FIRMWARE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are two
standardized methods for downloading microcode (i.e. device
firmware) to a SCSI device. The more general way is with the
SCSI WRITE BUFFER command, see the sg_write_buffer utility.
SCSI enclosures have their own method based on the Download
microcode control/status diagnostic page, see the
sg_ses_microcode utility.</p>

<h2>SCRIPTS, EXAMPLES and UTILS
<a name="SCRIPTS, EXAMPLES and UTILS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
several bash shell scripts in the &rsquo;scripts&rsquo;
subdirectory that invoke compiled utilities (e.g.
sg_readcap). Several of the scripts start with
&rsquo;scsi_&rsquo; rather than &rsquo;sg_&rsquo;. One
purpose of these scripts is to call the same utility (e.g.
sg_readcap) on multiple devices. Most of the basic compiled
utilities only allow one device as an argument. Some
distributions install these scripts in a more visible
directory (e.g. /usr/bin). Some of these scripts have man
page entries. See the README file in the
&rsquo;scripts&rsquo; subdirectory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There is some
example C code plus examples of complex invocations in the
&rsquo;examples&rsquo; subdirectory. There is also a README
file. The example C may be a simpler example of how to use a
SCSI pass-through in Linux than the main utilities (found in
the &rsquo;src&rsquo; subdirectory). This is due to the
fewer abstraction layers (e.g. they don&rsquo;t worry the
MinGW in Windows may open a file in text rather than binary
mode).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Some utilities
that the author has found useful have been placed in the
&rsquo;utils&rsquo; subdirectory.</p>

<h2>WEB SITE
