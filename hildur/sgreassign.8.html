send SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS command</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>sg_reassign</b>
[<i>--address=A,A...</i>] [<i>--dummy</i>]
[<i>--eight=0|1</i>] [<i>--grown</i>] [<i>--help</i>]
[<i>--hex</i>] [<i>--longlist=0|1</i>] [<i>--primary</i>]
[<i>--verbose</i>] [<i>--version</i>] <i>DEVICE</i></p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Send a SCSI
REASSIGN BLOCKS command to <i>DEVICE</i>. Alternatively this
utility can find the number of element in a
&quot;grown&quot; or &quot;primary&quot; defect list with a
SCSI READ DEFECT DATA (10) command. These SCSI commands are
defined in SBC-2 for direct access devices (e.g. a disk).
Reassign blocks is designed to change the physical location
of a logical block that is known or suspected to be
defective to another area on the media. Disks are typically
formatted with blocks held in reserve for this
situation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If neither the
<i>--grown</i> nor <i>--primary</i> option is supplied then
one or more addresses need to be given. If the address (or
all of the addresses) fit into 4 bytes and
&rsquo;--eight=1&rsquo; is not given then the parameter
block passed to <i>DEVICE</i> is made up of 4 byte logical
block addresses. If any of the addresses need more than 4
bytes to represent (i.e. &gt;= 2**32) or
&rsquo;--eight=1&rsquo; is given then the parameter block
passed to <i>DEVICE</i> is made up of 8 byte logical block
addresses.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Arguments to
long options are mandatory for short options as well. The
options are arranged in alphabetical order based on the long
option name. <b><br>
-a</b>, <b>--address</b>=<i>A,A...</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">where <i>A,A...</i> is a string
of comma separated numbers. Each number is interpreted as
decimal unless prefixed by &rsquo;0x&rsquo; or
&rsquo;0X&rsquo; (or it has a trailing &rsquo;h&rsquo; or
&rsquo;H&rsquo;). If multiple logical block addresses are
given they must be separated by a comma or a (single) space.
A string that contains any space separators needs to be
quoted. At least one address must be given.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-a</b>,
<b>--address</b>=-</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">reads one or more logical block
addresses from stdin. These may be comma, space, tab or
linefeed (newline) separated. If a line contains
&quot;#&quot; then the remaining characters on that line are
ignored. Otherwise each non separator sequence of characters
should resolve to a decimal number unless prefixed by
&rsquo;0x&rsquo; or &rsquo;0X&rsquo; (or has a trailing
&rsquo;h&rsquo;). At least one address must be given. Lines
should not be longer than 1023 bytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-d</b>, <b>--dummy</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">prepare for but do not execute
the SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS command. Since the REASSIGN BLOCKS
command is essentially irreversible, paranoid users may wish
to check the invocation of this utility before reassigning
defective blocks on a disk. Useful with &rsquo;-vv&rsquo;
for those who wish to view the parameter block that will
accompany the command.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-e</b>, <b>--eight</b>=0 |
1</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">when value is 1 then it sets
the &rsquo;LONGLBA&rsquo; flag in the command indicating
that the addresses in the associated parameter block are 8
byte quantities. When value is 0 then it clears the
&rsquo;LONGLBA&rsquo; flag in the command indicating that
the addresses in the associated parameter block are 4 byte
quantities. If this option is not given then 4 byte
quantities are assumed unless one of the address is too
large.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-g</b>, <b>--grown</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">use the SCSI READ DEFECT DATA
(10) command to determine the number of elements in the
&quot;grown defect list&quot;. When this option is given
there is no reassignment of blocks (i.e. this utility is
passive). When this option is given then the
<i>--address=</i> option is not permitted. See the
discussion below concerning the relationship between
reassigned blocks and the grown defect list. This list is
sometimes referred to as the GLIST.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">output the usage message then
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-H</b>, <b>--hex</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">print response in hex (for
<b>-g</b>, <b>--grown</b>, <b>-p</b> or
<b>--primary</b>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-l</b>, <b>--longlist</b>=0
| 1</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">sets the REASSIGN BLOCKS cdb
field of the same name to the given value. Only 1000
addresses are permitted so there should be no need to
specify a value of 1. The short list variant restricts the
parameter block length to 2 ** 16 bytes (i.e. about 16000 4
byte addresses or 8000 8 byte addresses). Added for
completeness.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-p</b>, <b>--primary</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">use the SCSI READ DEFECT DATA
(10) command to determine the number of elements in the
&quot;primary defect list&quot; which is established during
the manufacturing process. When this option is given there
is no reassignment of blocks (i.e. this utility is passive).
When this option is given then the <i>--address=</i> option
is not permitted. This list is sometimes referred to as the
PLIST.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">increase the level of
verbosity, (i.e. debug output).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">print the version string and
then exit.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that if
the ARRE field (for reads) and/or the AWRE field (for
writes) are set in the &quot;Read Write Error Recovery&quot;
mode page then recoverable read and/or write errors cause
automatic reassignment of the defective block. The PER bit
in the same mode page controls whether a RECOVERED ERROR
sense key is reported on not (PER=1 implies do report).
Irrespective of the ARRE, AWRE or PER field settings, the
error counter log pages reflect any errors (recovered or
otherwise). Whenever a block is reassigned, a new entry is
added in the &quot;grown&quot; defect list. Apart from doing
selftests (see sg_senddiag or smartmontools) regularly,
monitoring the grown defect list of a disk is a reasonable
metric of its health. If the grown list starts growing
quickly that is an ominous sign. The best grown defect lists
are empty ones. The number of elements in the grown defect
list can be viewed with the <i>--grown</i> option. The
contents of the grown defect list can be viewed with the
&rsquo;sginfo -G&rsquo; utility.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an
unrecoverable error is detected at a logical block address
then REASSIGN BLOCKS is needed to reassign the block. Also
if the ARRE and/or AWRE fields are clear and a recoverable
error is detected then the logical block in question may be
reassigned with this utility (otherwise the error counter
log pages will continually be incremented for each recovered
access).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The number of
blocks held in reserve for the purposes of REASSIGN BLOCKS
is vendor specific and may well be limited to the zone
within the media where the original (defective) block lay.
When this number is exhausted subsequent invocations of this
utility may result in a sense key of hardware error and an
additional sense of &rsquo;No defect spare location
available&rsquo;. The next step would be to reformat the
disk (or get a replacement).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SBC-2 draft
standard (revision 16) notes that when multiple addresses
are given to the SCSI REASSIGN BLOCKS command and there is
some failure at one of the later addresses then all
addresses prior to that have already be reassigned. Care
should be taken in such a case. Re-executing the command
with the same addresses will cause the earlier addresses to
be reassigned again. At some stage the disk will run out of
reserved locations. So unless a large number of addresses
are involved it may be safer to reassign them one address at
a time.</p>

<h2>EXIT STATUS
<a name="EXIT STATUS"></a>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The exit status
of sg_reassign is 0 when it is successful. Otherwise see the
sg3_utils(8) man page.</p>
