<h2>NAME

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">systemd.timer -
Timer unit configuration</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS
<a name="SYNOPSIS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>timer</i>.timer</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A unit
configuration file whose name ends in &quot;.timer&quot;
encodes information about a timer controlled and supervised
by systemd, for timer-based activation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This man page
lists the configuration options specific to this unit type.
See <b>systemd.unit</b>(5) for the common options of all
unit configuration files. The common configuration items are
configured in the generic &quot;[Unit]&quot; and
&quot;[Install]&quot; sections. The timer specific
configuration options are configured in the
&quot;[Timer]&quot; section.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For each timer
file, a matching unit file must exist, describing the unit
to activate when the timer elapses. By default, a service by
the same name as the timer (except for the suffix) is
activated. Example: a timer file foo.timer activates a
matching service foo.service. The unit to activate may be
controlled by <i>Unit=</i> (see below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that in
case the unit to activate is already active at the time the
timer elapses it is not restarted, but simply left running.
There is no concept of spawning new service instances in
this case. Due to this, services with
<i>RemainAfterExit=</i> set (which stay around continuously
even after the service's main process exited) are usually
not suitable for activation via repetitive timers, as they
will only be activated once, and then stay around
forever.</p>

<h2>AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES
<a name="AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCIES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Implicit
Dependencies</b> <br>
The following dependencies are implicitly added:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Timer
units automatically gain a <i>Before=</i> dependency on the
service they are supposed to activate.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Default
Dependencies</b> <br>
The following dependencies are added unless
<i>DefaultDependencies=no</i> is set:</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Timer
units will automatically have dependencies of type
<i>Requires=</i> and <i>After=</i> on sysinit.target, a
dependency of type <i>Before=</i> on timers.target, as well
as <i>Conflicts=</i> and <i>Before=</i> on shutdown.target
to ensure that they are stopped cleanly prior to system
shutdown. Only timer units involved with early boot or late
system shutdown should disable the
<i>DefaultDependencies=</i> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">&bull; Timer
units with at least one <i>OnCalendar=</i> directive will
have an additional <i>After=</i> dependency on
time-sync.target to avoid being started before the system
clock has been correctly set.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Timer files
must include a [Timer] section, which carries information
about the timer it defines. The options specific to the
[Timer] section of timer units are the following:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>OnActiveSec=</i>,
<i>OnBootSec=</i>, <i>OnStartupSec=</i>,
<i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i>, <i>OnUnitInactiveSec=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defines monotonic timers
relative to different starting points:</p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Table&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Settings
and their starting points</b> <br>
Multiple directives may be combined of the same and of
different types, in which case the timer unit will trigger
whenever any of the specified timer expressions elapse. For
example, by combining <i>OnBootSec=</i> and
<i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i>, it is possible to define a timer
that elapses in regular intervals and activates a specific
service each time. Moreover, both monotonic time expressions
and <i>OnCalendar=</i> calendar expressions may be combined
in the same timer unit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">The arguments
to the directives are time spans configured in seconds.
Example: &quot;OnBootSec=50&quot; means 50s after boot-up.
The argument may also include time units. Example:
&quot;OnBootSec=5h 30min&quot; means 5 hours and 30 minutes
after boot-up. For details about the syntax of time spans,
see <b>systemd.time</b>(7).</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If a timer
configured with <i>OnBootSec=</i> or <i>OnStartupSec=</i> is
already in the past when the timer unit is activated, it
will immediately elapse and the configured unit is started.
This is not the case for timers defined in the other
directives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">These are
monotonic timers, independent of wall-clock time and
timezones. If the computer is temporarily suspended, the
monotonic clock generally pauses, too. Note that if
<i>WakeSystem=</i> is used, a different monotonic clock is
selected that continues to advance while the system is
suspended and thus can be used as the trigger to resume the
system.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the empty
string is assigned to any of these options, the list of
timers is reset (both monotonic timers and
<i>OnCalendar=</i> timers, see below), and all prior
assignments will have no effect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time
configured with these settings, as they are subject to the
<i>AccuracySec=</i> setting below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>OnCalendar=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Defines realtime (i.e.
wallclock) timers with calendar event expressions. See
<b>systemd.time</b>(7) for more information on the syntax of
calendar event expressions. Otherwise, the semantics are
similar to <i>OnActiveSec=</i> and related settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time
configured with this setting, as it is subject to the
<i>AccuracySec=</i> setting below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">May be
specified more than once, in which case the timer unit will
trigger whenever any of the specified expressions elapse.
Moreover calendar timers and monotonic timers (see above)
may be combined within the same timer unit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">If the empty
string is assigned to any of these options, the list of
timers is reset (both <i>OnCalendar=</i> timers and
monotonic timers, see above), and all prior assignments will
have no effect.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>AccuracySec=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Specify the accuracy the timer
shall elapse with. Defaults to 1min. The timer is scheduled
to elapse within a time window starting with the time
specified in <i>OnCalendar=</i>, <i>OnActiveSec=</i>,
<i>OnBootSec=</i>, <i>OnStartupSec=</i>,
<i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i> or <i>OnUnitInactiveSec=</i> and
ending the time configured with <i>AccuracySec=</i> later.
Within this time window, the expiry time will be placed at a
host-specific, randomized, but stable position that is
synchronized between all local timer units. This is done in
order to optimize power consumption to suppress unnecessary
CPU wake-ups. To get best accuracy, set this option to 1us.
Note that the timer is still subject to the timer slack
configured via <b>systemd-system.conf</b>(5)'s
<i>TimerSlackNSec=</i> setting. See <b>prctl</b>(2) for
details. To optimize power consumption, make sure to set
this value as high as possible and as low as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
setting is primarily a power saving option that allows
coalescing CPU wake-ups. It should not be confused with
<i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> (see below) which adds a random
value to the time the timer shall elapse next and whose
purpose is the opposite: to stretch elapsing of timer events
over a longer period to reduce workload spikes. For further
details and explanations and how both settings play
together, see below.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Delay the timer by a randomly
selected, evenly distributed amount of time between 0 and
the specified time value. Defaults to 0, indicating that no
randomized delay shall be applied. Each timer unit will
determine this delay randomly before each iteration, and the
delay will simply be added on top of the next determined
elapsing time. This is useful to stretch dispatching of
similarly configured timer events over a certain amount
time, to avoid that they all fire at the same time, possibly
resulting in resource congestion. Note the relation to
<i>AccuracySec=</i> above: the latter allows the service
manager to coalesce timer events within a specified time
range in order to minimize wakeups, the former does the
opposite: it stretches timer events over a time range, to
make it unlikely that they fire simultaneously. If
<i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> and <i>AccuracySec=</i> are used
in conjunction, first the randomized delay is added, and
then the result is possibly further shifted to coalesce it
with other timer events happening on the system. As
mentioned above <i>AccuracySec=</i> defaults to 1min and
<i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> to 0, thus encouraging coalescing
of timer events. In order to optimally stretch timer events
over a certain range of time, make sure to set
<i>RandomizedDelaySec=</i> to a higher value, and
<i>AccuracySec=1us</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>OnClockChange=</i>,
<i>OnTimezoneChange=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">These options take boolean
arguments. When true, the service unit will be triggered
when the system clock (<b>CLOCK_REALTIME</b>) jumps relative
to the monotonic clock (<b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b>), or when the
local system timezone is modified. These options can be used
alone or in combination with other timer expressions (see
above) within the same timer unit. These options default to
false.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Unit=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">The unit to activate when this
timer elapses. The argument is a unit name, whose suffix is
not &quot;.timer&quot;. If not specified, this value
defaults to a service that has the same name as the timer
unit, except for the suffix. (See above.) It is recommended
that the unit name that is activated and the unit name of
the timer unit are named identically, except for the
suffix.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Persistent=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean argument. If
true, the time when the service unit was last triggered is
stored on disk. When the timer is activated, the service
unit is triggered immediately if it would have been
triggered at least once during the time when the timer was
inactive. This is useful to catch up on missed runs of the
service when the system was powered down. Note that this
setting only has an effect on timers configured with
<i>OnCalendar=</i>. Defaults to <i>false</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Use
<b>systemctl clean --what=state ...</b> on the timer unit to
remove the timestamp file maintained by this option from
disk. In particular, use this command before uninstalling a
timer unit. See <b>systemctl</b>(1) for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>WakeSystem=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean argument. If
true, an elapsing timer will cause the system to resume from
suspend, should it be suspended and if the system supports
this. Note that this option will only make sure the system
resumes on the appropriate times, it will not take care of
suspending it again after any work that is to be done is
finished. Defaults to <i>false</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that this
functionality requires privileges and is thus generally only
available in the system service manager.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
behaviour of monotonic clock timers (as configured with
<i>OnActiveSec=</i>, <i>OnBootSec=</i>,
<i>OnStartupSec=</i>, <i>OnUnitActiveSec=</i>,
<i>OnUnitInactiveSec=</i>, see above) is altered depending
on this option. If false, a monotonic clock is used that is
paused during system suspend (<b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b>), if
true a different monotonic clock is used that continues
advancing during system suspend (<b>CLOCK_BOOTTIME</b>), see
<b>clock_getres</b>(2) for details.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>RemainAfterElapse=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean argument. If
true, an elapsed timer will stay loaded, and its state
remains queryable. If false, an elapsed timer unit that
cannot elapse anymore is unloaded. Turning this off is
particularly useful for transient timer units that shall
disappear after they first elapse. Note that this setting
has an effect on repeatedly starting a timer unit that only
elapses once: if <i>RemainAfterElapse=</i> is on, it will
not be started again, and is guaranteed to elapse only once.
However, if <i>RemainAfterElapse=</i> is off, it might be
started again if it is already elapsed, and thus be
triggered multiple times. Defaults to <i>yes</i>.</p>
