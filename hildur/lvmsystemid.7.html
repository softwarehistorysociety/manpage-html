<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">lvmsystemid
&mdash; LVM system ID</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>lvm</b>(8) system ID restricts Volume Group (VG) access
to one host. This is useful when a VG is placed on shared
storage devices, or when local devices are visible to both
host and guest operating systems. In cases like these, a VG
can be visible to multiple hosts at once, and some mechanism
is needed to protect it from being used by more than one
host at a time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A VG&rsquo;s
system ID identifies one host as the VG owner. The host with
a matching system ID can use the VG and its LVs, while LVM
on other hosts will ignore it. This protects the VG from
being accidentally used from other hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The system ID
is a string that uniquely identifies a host. It can be
configured as a custom value, or it can be assigned
automatically by LVM using some unique identifier already
available on the host, e.g. machine-id or uname.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a new VG
is created, the system ID of the local host is recorded in
the VG metadata. The creating host then owns the new VG, and
LVM on other hosts will ignore it. When an existing,
exported VG is imported (vgimport), the system ID of the
local host is saved in the VG metadata, and the importing
host owns the VG.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A VG without a
system ID can be used by LVM on any host where the
VG&rsquo;s devices are visible. When system IDs are not
used, device filters should be configured on all hosts to
exclude the VG&rsquo;s devices from all but one host.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <b>foreign
VG</b> is a VG seen by a host with an unmatching system ID,
i.e. the system ID in the VG metadata does not match the
system ID configured on the host. If the host has no system
ID, and the VG does, the VG is foreign and LVM will ignore
it. If the VG has no system ID, access is unrestricted, and
LVM can access it from any host, whether the host has a
system ID or not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Changes to a
host&rsquo;s system ID and a VG&rsquo;s system ID can be
made in limited circumstances (see vgexport and vgimport).
Improper changes can result in a host losing access to its
VG, or a VG being accidentally damaged by access from an
unintended host. Even limited changes to the VG system ID
may not be perfectly reflected across hosts. A more coherent
view of shared storage requires an inter-host locking system
to coordinate access.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Valid system ID
characters are the same as valid VG name characters. If a
system ID contains invalid characters, those characters are
omitted and remaining characters are used. If a system ID is
longer than the maximum name length, the characters up to
the maximum length are used. The maximum length of a system
ID is 128 characters.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Print the
system ID of a VG to check if it is set:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgs -o

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Limitations
and warnings</b> <br>
To benefit fully from system ID, all hosts should have a
system ID configured, and all VGs should have a system ID
set. Without any method to restrict access, e.g. system ID
or device filters, a VG that is visible to multiple hosts
can be accidentally damaged or destroyed.</p>

<p>Many VGs will not have a system ID set because LVM has
not enabled it by default, and even when enabled, many VGs
were created before the feature was added to LVM or enabled.
A system ID can be assigned to these VGs by using vgchange

<p>A host using an old LVM version (without the system ID
feature) will not recognize a system ID set in VGs. The old
LVM can read a VG with a system ID, but is prevented from
writing to the VG (or its LVs). The system ID feature
changes the write mode of a VG, making it appear read-only
to previous versions of LVM.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:14%; margin-top: 1em">This also means
that if a host downgrades to the old LVM version, it would
lose access to any VGs it had created with a system ID. To
avoid this, the system ID should be removed from local VGs
before downgrading LVM to a version without the system ID
feature.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Types of VG
access</b> <br>
A local VG is meant to be used by a single host.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A shared or
clustered VG is meant to be used by multiple hosts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These can be
further distinguished as:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Unrestricted:</b>
A local VG that has no system ID. This VG type is
unprotected and accessible to any host.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Owned:</b> A
local VG that has a system ID set, as viewed from the host
with a matching system ID (the owner). This VG type is
acessible to the host.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Foreign:</b>
A local VG that has a system ID set, as viewed from any host
with an unmatching system ID (or no system ID). It is owned
by another host. This VG type is not accessible to the
host.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Exported:</b>
A local VG that has been exported with vgexport and has no
system ID. This VG type can only be accessed by vgimport
which will change it to owned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Shared:</b>
A shared or &quot;lockd&quot; VG has the lock_type set and
has no system ID. A shared VG is meant to be used on shared
storage from multiple hosts, and is only accessible to hosts
using lvmlockd. Applicable only if LVM is compiled with
lvmlockd support.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Clustered:</b>
A clustered or &quot;clvm&quot; VG has the clustered flag
set and has no system ID. A clustered VG is meant to be used
on shared storage from multiple hosts, and is only
accessible to hosts using clvmd. Applicable only if LVM is
compiled with clvm support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Host system
ID configuration</b> <br>
A host&rsquo;s own system ID can be defined in a number of
ways. lvm.conf global/system_id_source defines the method
LVM will use to find the local system ID:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">LVM will not use a system ID.
LVM is allowed to access VGs without a system ID, and will
create new VGs without a system ID. An undefined
system_id_source is equivalent to none.</p></td></tr>

}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Changing
system_id_source will likely cause the system ID of the host
to change, which will prevent the host from using VGs that
it previously used (see extra_system_ids below to handle
this.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a
system_id_source other than none fails to produce a system
ID value, it is the equivalent of having none. The host will
be allowed to access VGs with no system ID, but will not be
allowed to access VGs with a system ID set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Overriding
system ID</b> <br>
In some cases, it may be necessary for a host to access VGs
with different system IDs, e.g. if a host&rsquo;s system ID
changes, and it wants to use VGs that it created with its
old system ID. To allow a host to access VGs with other
system IDs, those other system IDs can be listed in
lvmlocal.conf local/extra_system_ids.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>lvmlocal.conf</i>
<br>
local { <br>
extra_system_ids = [ &quot;my_other_name&quot; ] <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A safer option
may be configuring the extra values as needed on the command
line as: <b><br>
--config
&rsquo;local/extra_system_ids=[&quot;</b><i>id</i><b>&quot;]&rsquo;</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgcreate</b>
<br>
In vgcreate, the host running the command assigns its own
system ID to the new VG. To override this and set another
system ID:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgcreate
--systemid</b> <i>SystemID VG PVs</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Overriding the
host&rsquo;s system ID makes it possible for a host to
create a VG that it may not be able to use. Another host
with a system ID matching the one specified may not
recognize the new VG without manually rescanning
devices.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the
--systemid argument is an empty string (&quot;&quot;), the
VG is created with no system ID, making it accessible to
other hosts (see warnings above.)</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>report/display</b>
<br>
The system ID of a VG is displayed with the
&quot;systemid&quot; reporting option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Report/display
commands ignore foreign VGs by default. To report foreign
VGs, the --foreign option can be used. This causes the VGs
to be read from disk.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgs
--foreign -o +systemid</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When a host
with no system ID sees foreign VGs, it warns about them as
they are skipped. The host should be assigned a system ID,
after which standard reporting commands will silently ignore
foreign VGs.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgexport/vgimport</b>
<br>
vgexport clears the VG system ID when exporting the VG.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">vgimport sets
the VG system ID to the system ID of the host doing the
import.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgchange</b>
<br>
A host can change the system ID of its own VGs, but the
command requires confirmation because the host may lose
access to the VG being changed:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>vgchange
--systemid</b> <i>SystemID VG</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The system ID
can be removed from a VG by specifying an empty string
(&quot;&quot;) as the new system ID. This makes the VG
accessible to other hosts (see warnings above.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A host cannot
directly change the system ID of a foreign VG.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To move a VG
from one host to another, vgexport and vgimport should be
used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To forcibly
gain ownership of a foreign VG, a host can temporarily add
the foreign system ID to its extra_system_ids list, and
change the system ID of the foreign VG to its own. See
Overriding system ID above.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>shared
VGs</b> <br>
A shared VG has no system ID set, allowing multiple hosts to
use it via lvmlockd. Changing a VG to shared will clear the
existing system ID. Applicable only if LVM is compiled with
lvmlockd support.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>clustered
VGs</b> <br>
A clustered/clvm VG has no system ID set, allowing multiple
hosts to use it via clvmd. Changing a VG to clustered will
clear the existing system ID. Changing a VG to not clustered
will set the system ID to the host running the vgchange
command.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>creation_host</b>
<br>
In vgcreate, the VG metadata field creation_host is set by
default to the host&rsquo;s uname. The creation_host cannot
be changed, and is not used to control access. When
system_id_source is &quot;uname&quot;, the system_id and
creation_host fields will be the same.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>orphans</b>
<br>
Orphan PVs are unused devices; they are not currently used
in any VG. Because of this, they are not protected by a
system ID, and any host can use them. Coordination of
changes to orphan PVs is beyond the scope of system ID. The
same is true of any block device that is not a PV.</p>
