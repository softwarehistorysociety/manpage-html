<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These
configuration files control local DNS and LLMNR name
resolution.</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE
<a name="CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The default
configuration is defined during compilation, so a
configuration file is only needed when it is necessary to
deviate from those defaults. By default, the configuration
file in /etc/systemd/ contains commented out entries showing
the defaults as a guide to the administrator. This file can
be edited to create local overrides.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When packages
need to customize the configuration, they can install
configuration snippets in /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/ or
/usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/. The main configuration
file is read before any of the configuration directories,
and has the lowest precedence; entries in a file in any
configuration directory override entries in the single
configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic
order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they
reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for
options which accept just a single value, the entry in the
file with the lexicographically latest name takes
precedence. For options which accept a list of values,
entries are collected as they occur in files sorted
lexicographically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Files in /etc/
are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this
logic to override the configuration files installed by
vendor packages. It is recommended to prefix all filenames
in those subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash,
to simplify the ordering of the files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To disable a
configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended
way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration
directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the vendor
configuration file.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
options are available in the &quot;[Resolve]&quot;
section:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>DNS=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A space-separated list of IPv4
and IPv6 addresses to use as system DNS servers. DNS
requests are sent to one of the listed DNS servers in
parallel to suitable per-link DNS servers acquired from
<b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) or set at runtime by
external applications. For compatibility reasons, if this
setting is not specified, the DNS servers listed in
/etc/resolv.conf are used instead, if that file exists and
any servers are configured in it. This setting defaults to
the empty list.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>FallbackDNS=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A space-separated list of IPv4
and IPv6 addresses to use as the fallback DNS servers. Any
per-link DNS servers obtained from
<b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) take precedence over this
setting, as do any servers set via <i>DNS=</i> above or
/etc/resolv.conf. This setting is hence only used if no
other DNS server information is known. If this option is not
given, a compiled-in list of DNS servers is used
instead.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>Domains=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">A space-separated list of
domains. These domains are used as search suffixes when
resolving single-label host names (domain names which
contain no dot), in order to qualify them into
fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs). Search domains are
strictly processed in the order they are specified, until
the name with the suffix appended is found. For
compatibility reasons, if this setting is not specified, the
search domains listed in /etc/resolv.conf are used instead,
if that file exists and any domains are configured in it.
This setting defaults to the empty list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em">Specified
domain names may optionally be prefixed with &quot;~&quot;.
In this case they do not define a search path, but
preferably direct DNS queries for the indicated domains to
the DNS servers configured with the system <i>DNS=</i>
setting (see above), in case additional, suitable per-link
DNS servers are known. If no per-link DNS servers are known
using the &quot;~&quot; syntax has no effect. Use the
construct &quot;~.&quot; (which is composed of &quot;~&quot;
to indicate a routing domain and &quot;.&quot; to indicate
the DNS root domain that is the implied suffix of all DNS
domains) to use the system DNS server defined with
<i>DNS=</i> preferably for all domains.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>LLMNR=</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;">Takes a boolean argument or
&quot;resolve&quot;. Controls Link-Local Multicast Name
Resolution support (<b><font color="#0000FF">RFC
4795</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[1]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">) on the local host. If true, enables
full LLMNR responder and resolver support. If false,
disables both. If set to &quot;resolve&quot;, only
resolution support is enabled, but responding is disabled.
Note that <b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) also maintains
per-link LLMNR settings. LLMNR will be enabled on a link
only if the per-link and the global setting is
on.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>MulticastDNS=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument or &quot;resolve&quot;. Controls Multicast
DNS support (</font><b><font color="#0000FF">RFC
6762</font></b>
<small><font color="#000000">[2]</font></small>
<font color="#000000">) on the local host. If true, enables
full Multicast DNS responder and resolver support. If false,
disables both. If set to &quot;resolve&quot;, only
resolution support is enabled, but responding is disabled.
Note that <b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) also maintains
per-link Multicast DNS settings. Multicast DNS will be
enabled on a link only if the per-link and the global
setting is on.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>DNSSEC=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument or &quot;allow-downgrade&quot;. If true all
DNS lookups are DNSSEC-validated locally (excluding LLMNR
and Multicast DNS). If the response to a lookup request is
detected to be invalid a lookup failure is returned to
applications. Note that this mode requires a DNS server that
supports DNSSEC. If the DNS server does not properly support
DNSSEC all validations will fail. If set to
&quot;allow-downgrade&quot; DNSSEC validation is attempted,
but if the server does not support DNSSEC properly, DNSSEC
mode is automatically disabled. Note that this mode makes
DNSSEC validation vulnerable to &quot;downgrade&quot;
attacks, where an attacker might be able to trigger a
downgrade to non-DNSSEC mode by synthesizing a DNS response
that suggests DNSSEC was not supported. If set to false, DNS
lookups are not DNSSEC validated.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that DNSSEC validation requires retrieval of additional DNS
data, and thus results in a small DNS look-up time
penalty.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">DNSSEC
requires knowledge of &quot;trust anchors&quot; to prove
data integrity. The trust anchor for the Internet root
domain is built into the resolver, additional trust anchors
may be defined with <b>dnssec-trust-anchors.d</b>(5). Trust
anchors may change at regular intervals, and old trust
anchors may be revoked. In such a case DNSSEC validation is
not possible until new trust anchors are configured locally
or the resolver software package is updated with the new
root trust anchor. In effect, when the built-in trust anchor
is revoked and <i>DNSSEC=</i> is true, all further lookups
will fail, as it cannot be proved anymore whether lookups
are correctly signed, or validly unsigned. If <i>DNSSEC=</i>
is set to &quot;allow-downgrade&quot; the resolver will
automatically turn off DNSSEC validation in such a
case.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Client
programs looking up DNS data will be informed whether
lookups could be verified using DNSSEC, or whether the
returned data could not be verified (either because the data
was found unsigned in the DNS, or the DNS server did not
support DNSSEC or no appropriate trust anchors were known).
In the latter case it is assumed that client programs employ
a secondary scheme to validate the returned DNS data, should
this be required.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">It
is recommended to set <i>DNSSEC=</i> to true on systems
where it is known that the DNS server supports DNSSEC
correctly, and where software or trust anchor updates happen
regularly. On other systems it is recommended to set
<i>DNSSEC=</i> to &quot;allow-downgrade&quot;.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
addition to this global DNSSEC setting
<b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) also maintains per-link
DNSSEC settings. For system DNS servers (see above), only
the global DNSSEC setting is in effect. For per-link DNS
servers the per-link setting is in effect, unless it is
unset in which case the global setting is used
instead.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Site-private
DNS zones generally conflict with DNSSEC operation, unless a
negative (if the private zone is not signed) or positive (if
the private zone is signed) trust anchor is configured for
them. If &quot;allow-downgrade&quot; mode is selected, it is
attempted to detect site-private DNS zones using top-level
domains (TLDs) that are not known by the DNS root server.
This logic does not work in all private zone
setups.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Defaults
to &quot;allow-downgrade&quot;</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>DNSOverTLS=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument or &quot;opportunistic&quot;. If true all
connections to the server will be encrypted. Note that this
mode requires a DNS server that supports DNS-over-TLS and
has a valid certificate for it's IP. If the DNS server does
not support DNS-over-TLS all DNS requests will fail. When
set to &quot;opportunistic&quot; DNS request are attempted
to send encrypted with DNS-over-TLS. If the DNS server does
not support TLS, DNS-over-TLS is disabled. Note that this
mode makes DNS-over-TLS vulnerable to &quot;downgrade&quot;
attacks, where an attacker might be able to trigger a
downgrade to non-encrypted mode by synthesizing a response
that suggests DNS-over-TLS was not supported. If set to
false, DNS lookups are send over UDP.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that DNS-over-TLS requires additional data to be send for
setting up an encrypted connection, and thus results in a
small DNS look-up time penalty.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that in &quot;opportunistic&quot; mode the resolver is not
capable of authenticating the server, so it is vulnerable to
&quot;man-in-the-middle&quot; attacks.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Server
Name Indication (SNI) can be used when opening a TLS
connection. Entries in <i>DNS=</i> should be in format
&quot;address#server_name&quot;.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">In
addition to this global DNSOverTLS setting
<b>systemd-networkd.service</b>(8) also maintains per-link
DNSOverTLS settings. For system DNS servers (see above),
only the global DNSOverTLS setting is in effect. For
per-link DNS servers the per-link setting is in effect,
unless it is unset in which case the global setting is used
instead.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Defaults
to off.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>Cache=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean or &quot;no-negative&quot; as argument. If
&quot;yes&quot;, resolving a domain name which already got
queried earlier will return the previous result as long as
it is still valid, and thus does not result in a new network
request. Be aware that turning off caching comes at a
performance penalty, which is particularly high when DNSSEC
is used.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">If
&quot;no-negative&quot; (the default), only positive answers
are cached.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that caching is turned off implicitly if the configured DNS
server is on a host-local IP address (such as 127.0.0.1 or
::1), in order to avoid duplicate local caching.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>DNSStubListener=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument or one of &quot;udp&quot; and
&quot;tcp&quot;. If &quot;udp&quot;, a DNS stub resolver
will listen for UDP requests on address 127.0.0.53 port 53.
If &quot;tcp&quot;, the stub will listen for TCP requests on
the same address and port. If &quot;yes&quot; (the default),
the stub listens for both UDP and TCP requests. If
&quot;no&quot;, the stub listener is disabled.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:17%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000">Note
that the DNS stub listener is turned off implicitly when its
listening address and port are already in use.</font></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><font color="#000000"><i>ReadEtcHosts=</i></font></p>

<p style="margin-left:17%;"><font color="#000000">Takes a
boolean argument. If &quot;yes&quot; (the default), the DNS
stub resolver will read /etc/hosts, and try to resolve hosts
or address by using the entries in the file before sending
query to DNS servers.</font></p>
