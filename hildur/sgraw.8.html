<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This utility
sends an arbitrary SCSI command (between 6 and 256 bytes) to
the <i>DEVICE</i>. There may be no associated data transfer;
or data may be read from a file and sent to the
<i>DEVICE</i>; or data may be received from the
<i>DEVICE</i> and then displayed or written to a file. If
supported by the pass through, bidirectional commands may be
sent (i.e. containing both data to be sent to the
<i>DEVICE</i> and received from the <i>DEVICE</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The SCSI
command may be between 6 and 256 bytes long. Each command
byte is specified in plain hex format (00..FF) without a
prefix or suffix. The command can be given either on the
command line or via the <i>--cmdfile=CF</i> option. See
EXAMPLES section below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The commands
pass through a generic SCSI interface which is implemented
for several operating systems including Linux, FreeBSD and
Windows.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Experimental
support has been added to send NVMe Admin commands to the
<i>DEVICE</i>. Since all NVMe commands are 64 bytes long it
is more convenient to use the <i>--cmdfile=CF</i> option
rather than type the 64 bytes of the NVMe command on the
command line. See the section on NVME below.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Arguments to
long options are mandatory for short options as well. The
options are arranged in alphabetical order based on the long
option name. <b><br>
-b</b>, <b>--binary</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Dump data in binary form, even
when writing to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-c</b>,
<b>--cmdfile</b>=<i>CF</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><i>CF</i> is the name of a file
which contains the command to be executed. Without this
option the command must be given on the command line, after
the options and the <i>DEVICE</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Display usage information and
exit.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-i</b>,
<b>--infile</b>=<i>IFILE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read data from <i>IFILE</i>
instead of stdin. This option is ignored if <b>--send</b> is
not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-n</b>, <b>--nosense</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Don&rsquo;t display SCSI Sense
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-o</b>,
<b>--outfile</b>=<i>OFILE</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Write data received from the
<i>DEVICE</i> to <i>OFILE</i>. The data is written in
binary. By default, data is dumped in hex format to stdout.
If <i>OFILE</i> is &rsquo;-&rsquo; then data is dumped in
binary to stdout. This option is ignored if <i>--request</i>
is not specified.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-R</b>,
<b>--readonly</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Open <i>DEVICE</i> read-only.
The default (without this option) is to open it
read-write.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-r</b>,
<b>--request</b>=<i>RLEN</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Expect to receive up to
<i>RLEN</i> bytes of data from the <i>DEVICE</i>.
<i>RLEN</i> may be suffixed with &rsquo;k&rsquo; to use
kilobytes (1024 bytes) instead of bytes. <i>RLEN</i> is
decimal unless it has a leading &rsquo;0x&rsquo; or a
trailing &rsquo;h&rsquo;. <br>
If <i>RLEN</i> is too small (i.e. either smaller than
indicated by the cdb (typically the &quot;allocation
length&quot; field) and/or smaller than the <i>DEVICE</i>
tries to send back) then the HBA driver may complain. Making
<i>RLEN</i> larger than required should cause no problems.
Most SCSI &quot;data-in&quot; commands return a data block
that contains (in its early bytes) a length that the
<i>DEVICE</i> would &quot;like&quot; to send back if the
&quot;allocation length&quot; field in the cdb is large
enough. In practice, the <i>DEVICE</i> will return no more
bytes than indicated in the &quot;allocation length&quot;
field of the cdb.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-s</b>,
<b>--send</b>=<i>SLEN</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Read <i>SLEN</i> bytes of data,
either from stdin or from a file, and send them to the
<i>DEVICE</i>. In the SCSI transport, <i>SLEN</i> becomes
the length (in bytes) of the &quot;data-out&quot; buffer.
<i>SLEN</i> is decimal unless it has a leading
&rsquo;0x&rsquo; or a trailing &rsquo;h&rsquo;. <br>
It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that the
&quot;data-out&quot; length implied or stated in the cdb
matches <i>SLEN</i>. Note that some common SCSI commands
such as WRITE(10) have a &quot;transfer length&quot; field
whose units are logical blocks (which are often 512 bytes
long).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-k</b>,
<b>--skip</b>=<i>KLEN</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Skip the first <i>KLEN</i>
bytes of the input file or stream. This option is ignored if
<i>--send</i> is not specified. If <i>--send</i> is given
and this option is not given, then zero bytes are
skipped.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-t</b>,
<b>--timeout</b>=<i>SECS</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Wait up to <i>SECS</i> seconds
for command completion (default: 20). Note that if a command
times out the operating system may start by aborting the
command and if that is unsuccessful it may attempt to reset
the device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Increase level of verbosity.
Can be used multiple times.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Display version and license
information and exit.</p>

<h2>NOTES
<a name="NOTES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The sg_inq
utility can be used to send an INQUIRY command to a device
to determine its peripheral device type (e.g.
&rsquo;1&rsquo; for a streaming device (tape drive)) which
determines which SCSI command sets a device should support
(e.g. SPC and SSC). The sg_vpd utility reads and decodes a
device&rsquo;s Vital Product Pages which may contain useful
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The ability to
send more than a 16 byte CDB (in some cases 12 byte CDB) may
be restricted by the pass-through interface, the low level
driver or the transport. In the Linux series 3 kernels, the
bsg driver can handle longer CDBs, block devices (e.g.
/dev/sdc) accessed via the SG_IO ioctl cannot handle CDBs
longer than 16 bytes, and the sg driver can handle longer
CDBs from lk 3.17 .</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The CDB command
name defined by T10 for the given CDB is shown if the
&rsquo;-vv&rsquo; option is given. The command line syntax
still needs to be correct, so /dev/null may be used for the
<i>DEVICE</i> since the CDB command name decoding is done
before the <i>DEVICE</i> is checked.</p>

<h2>NVME SUPPORT
<a name="NVME SUPPORT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Support for
NVMe (a.k.a. NVM Express) is currently experimental. NVMe
concepts map reasonably well to the SCSI architecture. A
SCSI logical unit (LU) is similar to a NVMe namespace
(although LUN 0 is very common in SCSI while namespace IDs
start at 1). A SCSI target device is similar to a NVMe
controller. SCSI commands vary from 6 to 260 bytes long
(although SCSI command descriptor blocks (cdb_s) longer than
32 bytes are uncommon) while all NVMe commands are currently
64 bytes long. The SCSI architecture makes a clear
distinction between an initiator (often called a HBA) and a
target (device) while (at least on the PCIe transport) the
NVMe controller plays both roles. At this time this utility
only supports &quot;Admin&quot; commands (i.e. it does not
support the I/O (or &quot;NVM&quot;) command set). Admin
commands are sent to submission queue 0 while non-admin
commands are sent to submissions greater than 0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One significant
difference is that SCSI uses a big endian representation for
integers that are longer than 8 bits (i.e. longer than 1
byte) while NVMe uses a little endian representation (like
most things that have originated from the Intel
organisation). NVMe specifications talk about Words (16
bits), Double Words (32 bits) and sometimes Quad Words (64
bits) and has tighter alignment requirements than SCSI.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One difference
that impacts this utility is that NVMe places pointers to
host memory in its commands while SCSI leaves this detail to
whichever transport it is using (e.g. SAS, iSCSI, SRP).
Since this utility takes the command from the user (either
on the command line or in a file named <i>CF</i>) but this
utility allocates a data-in or data-out buffer as required,
the user does not know in advance what the address of that
buffer will be. Some special addresses have been introduced
to help with this problem: the address 0xfffffffffffffffe is
interpreted as &quot;use the data-in buffer&rsquo;s
address&quot; while 0xfffffffffffffffd is interpreted as
&quot;use the data-out buffer&rsquo;s address&quot;. Since
NVMe uses little endian notation then that first address
appears in the NVMe command byte stream as &quot;fe&quot;
followed by seven &quot;ff&quot;s. A similar arrangement is
made for the length of that buffer, but since that is a 32
byte quantity, the first 4 bytes (all &quot;ff&quot;s) are
removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two command
file examples can be found in the examples directory of this
package&rsquo;s source tarball: nvme_identify_ctl.hex and
nvme_dev_self_test.hex .</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES
<a name="EXAMPLES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These examples,
apart from the last one, use Linux device names. For
suitable device names in other supported Operating Systems
see the sg3_utils(8) man page. <br>
sg_raw /dev/scd0 1b 00 00 00 02 00</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Eject the medium in CD drive
/dev/scd0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sg_raw -r 1k /dev/sg0 12 00 00
00 60 00</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Perform an INQUIRY on /dev/sg0
and dump the response data (up to 1024 bytes) to stdout.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sg_raw -s 512 -i i512.bin
/dev/sda 3b 02 00 00 00 00 00 02 00 00</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Showing an example of writing
512 bytes to a sector on a disk is a little dangerous.
Instead this example will read i512.bin (assumed to be 512
bytes long) and use the SCSI WRITE BUFFER command to send it
to the &quot;data&quot; buffer (that is mode 2). This is a
safe operation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sg_raw -r 512 -o o512.bin
/dev/sda 3c 02 00 00 00 00 00 02 00 00</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This will use the SCSI READ
BUFFER command to read 512 bytes from the &quot;data&quot;
buffer (i.e. mode 2) then write it to the o512.bin file.
When used in conjunction with the previous example, if both
commands work then &rsquo;cmp i512.bin o512.bin&rsquo;
should show a match.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sg_raw --infile=urandom.bin
--send=512 --request=512 --outfile=out.bin <br>
&quot;/dev/bsg/7:0:0:0&quot; 53 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01
00</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is a bidirectional
XDWRITEREAD(10) command being sent via a Linux bsg device.
Note that data is being read from &quot;urandom.bin&quot;
and sent to the device (data-out) while resulting data
(data-in) is placed in the &quot;out.bin&quot; file. Also
note the length of both is 512 bytes which corresponds to
the transfer length of 1 (block) in the cdb (i.e. the second
last byte).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sg_raw.exe PhysicalDrive1 a1 0c
0e 00 00 00 00 00 00 e0 00 00</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This example is from Windows
and shows a ATA STANDBY IMMEDIATE command being sent to
PhysicalDrive1. That ATA command is contained within the
SCSI ATA PASS-THROUGH(12) command (see the SAT or SAT-2
standard at http://www.t10.org). Notice that the STANDBY
IMMEDIATE command does not send or receive any additional
data, however if it fails sense data should be returned and
displayed.</p>
