      <p>Various function manual pages include a section ATTRIBUTES
      that describes the safety of calling the function in various
      contexts. This section annotates functions with the following
      safety markings:</p>
      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl class="variablelist">
          <dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>MT-Safe</code></em></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p><em class="replaceable"><code>MT-Safe</code></em> or
            Thread-Safe functions are safe to call in the presence
            of other threads. MT, in MT-Safe, stands for Multi
            Thread.</p>
            <p>Being MT-Safe does not imply a function is atomic,
            nor that it uses any of the memory synchronization
            mechanisms POSIX exposes to users. It is even possible
            that calling MT-Safe functions in sequence does not
            yield an MT-Safe combination. For example, having a
            thread call two MT-Safe functions one right after the
            other does not guarantee behavior equivalent to atomic
            execution of a combination of both functions, since
            concurrent calls in other threads may interfere in a
            destructive way.</p>
            <p>Whole-program optimizations that could inline
            functions across library interfaces may expose unsafe
            reordering, and so performing inlining across the GNU C
            Library interface is not recommended. The documented
            MT-Safety status is not guaranteed under whole-program
            optimization. However, functions defined in
            user-visible headers are designed to be safe for
            inlining.</p>

        <h3>Conditionally safe features</h3>
        <p>For some features that make functions unsafe to call in
        certain contexts, there are known ways to avoid the safety
        problem other than refraining from calling the function
        altogether. The keywords that follow refer to such
        features, and each of their definitions indicates how the
        whole program needs to be constrained in order to remove
        the safety problem indicated by the keyword. Only when all
        the reasons that make a function unsafe are observed and
        addressed, by applying the documented constraints, does the
        function become safe to call in a context.</p>
        <div class="variablelist">
          <dl class="variablelist">
            <dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>init</code></em></span></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Functions marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>init</code></em> as an MT-Unsafe
              feature perform MT-Unsafe initialization when they
              are first called.</p>
              <p>Calling such a function at least once in
              single-threaded mode removes this specific cause for
              the function to be regarded as MT-Unsafe. If no other
              cause for that remains, the function can then be
              safely called after other threads are started.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>race</code></em></span></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Functions annotated with <em class="replaceable"><code>race</code></em> as an MT-Safety
              issue operate on objects in ways that may cause data
              races or similar forms of destructive interference
              out of concurrent execution. In some cases, the
              objects are passed to the functions by users; in
              others, they are used by the functions to return
              values to users; in others, they are not even exposed
              to users.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>const</code></em></span></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Functions marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>const</code></em> as an MT-Safety
              issue non-atomically modify internal objects that are
              better regarded as constant, because a substantial
              portion of the GNU C Library accesses them without
              synchronization. Unlike <em class="replaceable"><code>race</code></em>, which causes
              both readers and writers of internal objects to be
              regarded as MT-Unsafe, this mark is applied to
              writers only. Writers remain MT-Unsafe to call, but
              the then-mandatory constness of objects they modify
              enables readers to be regarded as MT-Safe (as long as
              no other reasons for them to be unsafe remain), since
              the lack of synchronization is not a problem when the
              objects are effectively constant.</p>
              <p>The identifier that follows the <em class="replaceable"><code>const</code></em> mark will
              appear by itself as a safety note in readers.
              Programs that wish to work around this safety issue,
              so as to call writers, may use a non-recursive
              read-write lock associated with the identifier, and
              guard <em class="replaceable"><code>all</code></em>
              calls to functions marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>const</code></em> followed by the
              identifier with a write lock, and <em class="replaceable"><code>all</code></em> calls to
              functions marked with the identifier by itself with a
              read lock.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>sig</code></em></span></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Functions marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>sig</code></em> as a MT-Safety
              issue may temporarily install a signal handler for
              internal purposes, which may interfere with other
              uses of the signal, identified after a colon.</p>
              <p>This safety problem can be worked around by
              ensuring that no other uses of the signal will take
              place for the duration of the call. Holding a
              non-recursive mutex while calling all functions that
              use the same temporary signal; blocking that signal
              before the call and resetting its handler afterwards
              is recommended.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>term</code></em></span></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Functions marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>term</code></em> as an MT-Safety
              issue may change the terminal settings in the
              recommended way, namely: call <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/termios.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">tcgetattr</span>(3)</span></a>,
              modify some flags, and then call <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/termios.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">tcsetattr</span>(3)</span></a>, this
              creates a window in which changes made by other
              threads are lost. Thus, functions marked with
              <em class="replaceable"><code>term</code></em> are
              MT-Unsafe.</p>
              <p>It is thus advisable for applications using the
              terminal to avoid concurrent and reentrant
              interactions with it, by not using it in signal
              handlers or blocking signals that might use it, and
              holding a lock while calling these functions and
              interacting with the terminal. This lock should also
              be used for mutual exclusion with functions marked
              with <em class="replaceable"><code>race:tcattr(fd)</code></em>,
              where <em class="replaceable"><code>fd</code></em> is
              a file descriptor for the controlling terminal. The
              caller may use a single mutex for simplicity, or use
              one mutex per terminal, even if referenced by
              different file descriptors.</p>

        <h3>Other safety remarks</h3>
        <p>Additional keywords may be attached to functions,
        indicating features that do not make a function unsafe to
        call, but that may need to be taken into account in certain
        classes of programs:</p>
        <div class="variablelist">
          <dl class="variablelist">
            <dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>locale</code></em></span></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Functions annotated with <em class="replaceable"><code>locale</code></em> as an
              MT-Safety issue read from the locale object without
              any form of synchronization. Functions annotated with
              <em class="replaceable"><code>locale</code></em>
              called concurrently with locale changes may behave in
              ways that do not correspond to any of the locales
              active during their execution, but an unpredictable
              mix thereof.</p>
              <p>We do not mark these functions as MT-Unsafe,
              however, because functions that modify the locale
              object are marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>const:locale</code></em> and
              regarded as unsafe. Being unsafe, the latter are not
              to be called when multiple threads are running or
              asynchronous signals are enabled, and so the locale
              can be considered effectively constant in these
              contexts, which makes the former safe.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>env</code></em></span></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Functions marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>env</code></em> as an MT-Safety

              similar, without any guards to ensure safety in the
              presence of concurrent modifications.</p>
              <p>We do not mark these functions as MT-Unsafe,
              however, because functions that modify the
              environment are all marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>const:env</code></em> and
              regarded as unsafe. Being unsafe, the latter are not
              to be called when multiple threads are running or
              asynchronous signals are enabled, and so the
              environment can be considered effectively constant in
              these contexts, which makes the former safe.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>hostid</code></em></span></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>The function marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>hostid</code></em> as an
              MT-Safety issue reads from the system-wide data
              structures that hold the "host ID" of the machine.
              These data structures cannot generally be modified
              atomically. Since it is expected that the "host ID"
              will not normally change, the function that reads
              from it (<a class="link" href="../htmlman3/gethostid.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">gethostid</span>(3)</span></a>) is
              regarded as safe, whereas the function that modifies
              it (<a class="link" href="../htmlman3/gethostid.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">sethostid</span>(3)</span></a>) is
              marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>const:hostid</code></em>,
              indicating it may require special care if it is to be
              called. In this specific case, the special care
              amounts to system-wide (not merely intra-process)
              coordination.</p>

            <dd>
              <p>Functions marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>sigintr</code></em> as an

              data structure without any guards to ensure safety in
              the presence of concurrent modifications.</p>
              <p>We do not mark these functions as MT-Unsafe,
              however, because functions that modify this data
              structure are all marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>const:sigintr</code></em> and
              regarded as unsafe. Being unsafe, the latter are not
              to be called when multiple threads are running or
              asynchronous signals are enabled, and so the data
              structure can be considered effectively constant in
              these contexts, which makes the former safe.</p>

              <p>Functions marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>cwd</code></em> as an MT-Safety
              issue may temporarily change the current working
              directory during their execution, which may cause
              relative pathnames to be resolved in unexpected ways
              in other threads or within asynchronous signal or
              cancellation handlers.</p>
              <p>This is not enough of a reason to mark so-marked
              functions as MT-Unsafe, but when this behavior is
              optional (e.g., <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/ftw.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">nftw</span>(3)</span></a> with
              <code class="constant">FTW_CHDIR</code>), avoiding
              the option may be a good alternative to using full
              pathnames or file descriptor-relative (e.g.,
              <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/open.2.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">openat</span>(2)</span></a>) system
              calls.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="term"><em class="replaceable"><code>:identifier</code></em></span></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Annotations may sometimes be followed by
              identifiers, intended to group several functions
              that, for example, access the data structures in an
              unsafe way, as in <em class="replaceable"><code>race</code></em> and <em class="replaceable"><code>const</code></em>, or to provide
              more specific information, such as naming a signal in
              a function marked with <em class="replaceable"><code>sig</code></em>. It is envisioned
              that it may be applied to <em class="replaceable"><code>lock</code></em> and <em class="replaceable"><code>corrupt</code></em> as well in
              the future.</p>
              <p>In most cases, the identifier will name a set of
              functions, but it may name global objects or function
              arguments, or identifiable properties or logical
              components associated with them, with a notation such
              as, for example, <em class="replaceable"><code>:buf(arg)</code></em> to denote a
              buffer associated with the argument <em class="replaceable"><code>arg</code></em>, or <em class="replaceable"><code>:tcattr(fd)</code></em> to denote
              the terminal attributes of a file descriptor
              <em class="replaceable"><code>fd</code></em>.</p>
              <p>The most common use for identifiers is to provide
              logical groups of functions and arguments that need
              to be protected by the same synchronization primitive
              in order to ensure safe operation in a given
              context.</p>

            <dt><span class="term"><code class="filename">/condition</code></span></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Some safety annotations may be conditional, in
              that they only apply if a boolean expression
              involving arguments, global variables or even the
              underlying kernel evaluates to true. For example,
              <code class="filename">/!ps</code> and <code class="filename">/one_per_line</code> indicate the
              preceding marker only applies when argument
              <em class="replaceable"><code>ps</code></em> is NULL,
              or global variable <em class="replaceable"><code>one_per_line</code></em> is
              nonzero.</p>
              <p>When all marks that render a function unsafe are
              adorned with such conditions, and none of the named
              conditions hold, then the function can be regarded as
              safe.</p>
