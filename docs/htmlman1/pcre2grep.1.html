      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
      <p><span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>
      searches files for character patterns, in the same way as
      other grep commands do, but it uses the PCRE2 regular
      expression library to support patterns that are compatible
      with the regular expressions of Perl 5. See <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2syntax.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2syntax</span>(3)</span></a> for a
      quick-reference summary of pattern syntax, or <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2pattern.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2pattern</span>(3)</span></a> for a full
      description of the syntax and semantics of the regular
      expressions that PCRE2 supports.</p>
      <p>Patterns, whether supplied on the command line or in a
      separate file, are given without delimiters. For example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
pcre2grep Thursday /etc/motd
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>If you attempt to use delimiters (for example, by
      surrounding a pattern with slashes, as is common in Perl
      scripts), they are interpreted as part of the pattern. Quotes
      can of course be used to delimit patterns on the command line
      because they are interpreted by the shell, and indeed quotes
      are required if a pattern contains white space or shell
      metacharacters.</p>
      <p>The first argument that follows any option settings is
      treated as the single pattern to be matched when neither
      <code class="option">−e</code> nor <code class="option">−f</code> is present. Conversely, when one or
      both of these options are used to specify patterns, all
      arguments are treated as path names. At least one of
      <code class="option">−e</code>, <code class="option">−f</code>, or an argument pattern must be
      provided.</p>
      <p>If no files are specified, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> reads the
      standard input. The standard input can also be referenced by
      a name consisting of a single hyphen. For example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
pcre2grep some-pattern file1 - file3
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Input files are searched line by line. By default, each
      line that matches a pattern is copied to the standard output,
      and if there is more than one file, the file name is output
      at the start of each line, followed by a colon. However,
      there are options that can change how <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> behaves. In
      particular, the <code class="option">−M</code> option
      makes it possible to search for strings that span line
      boundaries. What defines a line boundary is controlled by the
      <code class="option">−N</code> (<code class="option">−−newline</code>) option.</p>
      <p>The amount of memory used for buffering files that are
      being scanned is controlled by a parameter that can be set by
      the <code class="option">−−buffer−size</code> option. The
      default value for this parameter is specified when
      <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> is
      built, with the default default being 20K. A block of memory
      three times this size is used (to allow for buffering
      "before" and "after" lines). An error occurs if a line
      overflows the buffer.</p>
      <p>Patterns can be no longer than 8K or BUFSIZ bytes,
      whichever is the greater. BUFSIZ is defined in <code class="literal">&lt;</code><code class="filename">stdio.h</code><code class="literal">&gt;</code>
      When there is more than one pattern (specified by the use of
      <code class="option">−e</code> and/or <code class="option">−f</code>), each pattern is applied to each
      line in the order in which they are defined, except that all
      the <code class="option">−e</code> patterns are tried
      before the <code class="option">−f</code> patterns.</p>
      <p>By default, as soon as one pattern matches a line, no
      further patterns are considered. However, if <code class="option">−−colour</code> (or <code class="option">−−color</code>) is used to colour the
      matching substrings, or if <code class="option">−−only−matching</code>,
      <code class="option">−−file−offsets</code>,
      or <code class="option">−−line−offsets</code> is used to
      output only the part of the line that matched (either shown
      literally, or as an offset), scanning resumes immediately
      following the match, so that further matches on the same line
      can be found. If there are multiple patterns, they are all
      tried on the remainder of the line, but patterns that follow
      the one that matched are not tried on the earlier part of the
      line.</p>
      <p>This behaviour means that the order in which multiple
      patterns are specified can affect the output when one of the
      above options is used. This is no longer the same behaviour
      as GNU grep, which now manages to display earlier matches for
      later patterns (as long as there is no overlap).</p>
      <p>Patterns that can match an empty string are accepted, but
      empty string matches are never recognized. An example is the
      pattern "(super)?(man)?", in which all components are
      optional. This pattern finds all occurrences of both "super"
      and "man"; the output differs from matching with "super|man"
      when only the matching substrings are being shown.</p>
      <p>If the <code class="constant">LC_ALL</code> or
      <code class="constant">LC_CTYPE</code> environment variable
      is set, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> uses the value to
      set a locale when calling the PCRE2 library. The <code class="option">−−locale</code> option can be used to
      override this.</p>

      <h2>SUPPORT FOR COMPRESSED FILES</h2>
      <p>It is possible to compile <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> so that it uses
      <span class="command"><strong>libz</strong></span> or
      <span class="command"><strong>libbz2</strong></span> to read
      files whose names end in <em class="replaceable"><code>.gz</code></em> or <em class="replaceable"><code>.bz2</code></em>, respectively. You can
      find out whether your binary has support for one or both of
      these file types by running it with the <code class="option">−−help</code> option. If the appropriate
      support is not present, files are treated as plain text. The
      standard input is always so treated.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2grep-1_sect3" name="pcre2grep-1_sect3" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>BINARY FILES</h2>
      <p>By default, a file that contains a binary zero byte within
      the first 1024 bytes is identified as a binary file, and is
      processed specially. (GNU grep also identifies binary files
      in this manner.) See the <code class="option">−−binary−files</code> option for a
      means of changing the way binary files are handled.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2grep-1_sect4" name="pcre2grep-1_sect4" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
      <p>The order in which some of the options appear can affect
      the output. For example, both the <code class="option">−h</code> and <code class="option">−l</code> options affect the printing of file
      names. Whichever comes later in the command line will be the
      one that takes effect. Similarly, except where noted below,
      if an option is given twice, the later setting is used.
      Numerical values for options may be followed by K or M, to
      signify multiplication by 1024 or 1024*1024 respectively.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>This terminates the list of options. It is useful if
            the next item on the command line starts with a hyphen
            but is not an option. This allows for the processing of
            patterns and file names that start with hyphens.</p>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−A</code> <span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span>, <code class="option">−−after−context=</code><span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Output <span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span> lines of
            context after each matching line. If file names and/or
            line numbers are being output, a hyphen separator is
            used instead of a colon for the context lines. A line
            containing "--" is output between each group of lines,
            unless they are in fact contiguous in the input file.
            The value of <span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span> is expected to
            be relatively small. However, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> guarantees
            to have up to 8K of following text available for
            context output.</p>

            used instead of a colon for the context lines. A line
            containing "--" is output between each group of lines,
            unless they are in fact contiguous in the input file.
            The value of <span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span> is expected to
            be relatively small. However, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> guarantees
            to have up to 8K of preceding text available for
            context output.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>Specify how binary files are to be processed. If the
            word is "binary" (the default), pattern matching is
            performed on binary files, but the only output is
            "Binary file &lt;name&gt; matches" when a match
            succeeds. If the word is "text", which is equivalent to
            the <code class="option">−a</code> or
            <code class="option">−−text</code> option,
            binary files are processed in the same way as any other
            file. In this case, when a match succeeds, the output
            may be binary garbage, which can have nasty effects if
            sent to a terminal. If the word is "without-match",
            which is equivalent to the <code class="option">−I</code> option, binary files are not
            processed at all; they are assumed not to be of
            interest and are skipped without causing any output or
            affecting the return code.</p>

            <p>Output <span class="command"><strong>number</strong></span> lines of
            context both before and after each matching line. This
            is equivalent to setting both <code class="option">−A</code> and <code class="option">−B</code> to the same value.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−c</code>, <code class="option">−−count</code></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Do not output lines from the files that are being
            scanned; instead output the number of matches (or
            non-matches if <code class="option">−v</code> is
            used) that would otherwise have caused lines to be
            shown. By default, this count is the same as the number
            of suppressed lines, but if the <code class="option">−M</code> (multiline) option is used
            (without <code class="option">−v</code>), there
            may be more suppressed lines than the number of
            matches.</p>
            <p>If no lines are selected, the number zero is output.
            If several files are are being scanned, a count is
            output for each of them. However, if the <code class="option">−−files−with−matches</code>
            option is also used, only those files whose counts are
            greater than zero are listed. When <code class="option">−c</code> is used, the <code class="option">−A</code>, <code class="option">−B</code>, and <code class="option">−C</code> options are ignored.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>If this option is given without any data, it is
            equivalent to "--colour=auto". If data is required, it
            must be given in the same shell item, separated by an
            equals sign.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>This option specifies under what circumstances the
            parts of a line that matched a pattern should be
            coloured in the output. By default, the output is not
            coloured. The value (which is optional, see above) may
            be "never", "always", or "auto". In the latter case,
            colouring happens only if the standard output is
            connected to a terminal. More resources are used when
            colouring is enabled, because <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> has to
            search for all possible matches in a line, not just
            one, in order to colour them all.</p>
            <p>The colour that is used can be specified by setting
            the environment variable PCRE2GREP_COLOUR or
            PCRE2GREP_COLOR. The value of this variable should be a
            string of two numbers, separated by a semicolon. They
            are copied directly into the control string for setting
            colour on a terminal, so it is your responsibility to
            ensure that they make sense. If neither of the
            environment variables is set, the default is "1;31",
            which gives red.</p>

            <p>If an input path is not a regular file or a
            directory, "action" specifies how it is to be
            processed. Valid values are "read" (the default) or

            <p>If an input path is a directory, "action" specifies
            how it is to be processed. Valid values are "read" (the
            default in non-Windows environments, for compatibility
            with GNU grep), "recurse" (equivalent to the
            <code class="option">−r</code> option), or "skip"
            (silently skip the path, the default in Windows
            environments). In the "read" case, directories are read
            as if they were ordinary files. In some operating
            systems the effect of reading a directory like this is
            an immediate end-of-file; in others it may provoke an
            error.</p>

            single pattern that starts with a hyphen. When
            <code class="option">−e</code> is used, no
            argument pattern is taken from the command line; all
            arguments are treated as file names. There is no limit
            to the number of patterns. They are applied to each

            <code class="option">−e</code>, the command line
            patterns are matched first, followed by the patterns
            from the file(s), independent of the order in which
            these options are specified. Note that multiple use of
            <code class="option">−e</code> is not the same as
            a single pattern with alternatives. For example, X|Y
            finds the first character in a line that is X or Y,
            whereas if the two patterns are given separately, with
            X first, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> finds X if
            it is present, even if it follows Y in the line. It
            finds Y only if there is no X in the line. This matters
            only if you are using <code class="option">−o</code> or <code class="option">−−colo(u)r</code> to show the
            part(s) of the line that matched.</p>

            scanning a directory. The pattern is a PCRE2 regular

            of the file name, not the entire path. The <code class="option">−F</code>, <code class="option">−w</code>, and <code class="option">−x</code> options do not apply to this

            cases to a program crash if not enough is available.
            Other patterns may take a very long time to search for
            all possible matching strings. The <code class="function">pcre2_match</code>() function that is called
            by <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> to do the
            matching has two parameters that can limit the
            resources that it uses.</p>
            <p>The <code class="option">−−match−limit</code> option
            provides a means of limiting resource usage when
            processing patterns that are not going to match, but
            which have a very large number of possibilities in
            their search trees. The classic example is a pattern
            that uses nested unlimited repeats. Internally, PCRE2
            uses a function called <code class="function">match</code>() which it calls repeatedly
            (sometimes recursively). The limit set by <code class="option">−−match−limit</code> is
            imposed on the number of times this function is called
            during a match, which has the effect of limiting the
            amount of backtracking that can take place.</p>
            <p>The <code class="option">−−recursion−limit</code>
            option is similar to <code class="option">−−match−limit</code>, but
            instead of limiting the total number of times that
            <code class="function">match</code>() is called, it
            limits the depth of recursive calls, which in turn
            limits the amount of memory that can be used. The
            recursion depth is a smaller number than the total
            number of calls, because not all calls to <code class="function">match</code>() are recursive. This limit is
            of use only if it is set smaller than <code class="option">−−match−limit</code>.</p>
            <p>There are no short forms for these options. The
            default settings are specified when the PCRE2 library
            is compiled, with the default default being 10
            million.</p>

            <p>Allow patterns to match more than one line. When
            this option is given, patterns may usefully contain
            literal newline characters and internal occurrences of
            ^ and $ characters. The output for a successful match
            may consist of more than one line. The first is the
            line in which the match started, and the last is the
            line in which the match ended. If the matched string
            ends with a newline sequence the output ends at the end
            of that line.</p>
            <p>When this option is set, the PCRE2 library is called
            in "multiline" mode. This allows a matched string to
            extend past the end of a line and continue on one or
            more subsequent lines. However, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> still
            processes the input line by line. Once a match has been
            handled, scanning restarts at the beginning of the next
            line, just as it does when <code class="option">−M</code> is not present. This means
            that it is possible for the second or subsequent lines
            in a multiline match to be output again as part of
            another match.</p>
            <p>The newline sequence that separates multiple lines
            must be matched as part of the pattern. For example, to
            find the phrase "regular expression" in a file where
            "regular" might be at the end of a line and
            "expression" at the start of the next line, you could
            use this command:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
pcre2grep -M 'regular\s+expression' &lt;file&gt;
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>The \s escape sequence matches any white space
            character, including newlines, and is followed by + so
            as to match trailing white space on the first line as
            well as possibly handling a two-character newline
            sequence.</p>
            <p>There is a limit to the number of lines that can be
            matched, imposed by the way that <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> buffers the
            input file as it scans it. However, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> ensures
            that at least 8K characters or the rest of the file
            (whichever is the shorter) are available for forward
            matching, and similarly the previous 8K characters (or
            all the previous characters, if fewer than 8K) are
            guaranteed to be available for lookbehind assertions.

            <p>The PCRE2 library supports five different
            conventions for indicating the ends of lines. They are
            the single-character sequences CR (carriage return) and
            LF (linefeed), the two-character sequence CRLF, an
            "anycrlf" convention, which recognizes any of the
            preceding three types, and an "any" convention, in
            which any Unicode line ending sequence is assumed to
            end a line. The Unicode sequences are the three just
            mentioned, plus VT (vertical tab, U+000B), FF (form
            feed, U+000C), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line
            separator, U+2028), and PS (paragraph separator,
            U+2029).</p>
            <p>When the PCRE2 library is built, a default
            line-ending sequence is specified. This is normally the
            standard sequence for the operating system. Unless
            otherwise specified by this option, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> uses the
            library's default. The possible values for this option
            are CR, LF, CRLF, ANYCRLF, or ANY. This makes it
            possible to use <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> to scan
            files that have come from other environments without
            having to modify their line endings. If the data that
            is being scanned does not agree with the convention set
            by this option, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> may behave
            in strange ways. Note that this option does not apply
            to files specified by the <code class="option">−f</code>, <code class="option">−−exclude−from</code>, or
            <code class="option">−−include−from</code>
            options, which are expected to use the operating
            system's standard newline sequence.</p>

            being output, it precedes the line number. When the
            <code class="option">−M</code> option causes a
            pattern to match more than one line, only the first is
            preceded by its line number. This option is forced if

            automatically makes use of this, unless it was

            without a number. Because these options can be given
            without an argument (see above), if an argument is
            present, it must be given in the same shell item, for
            example, -o3 or --only-matching=2. The comments given
            for the non-argument case above also apply to this
            case. If the specified capturing parentheses do not
            exist in the pattern, or were not set in the match,

            <p>If this option is given multiple times, multiple
            substrings are output, in the order the options are

      <h2>NEWLINES</h2>
      <p>The <code class="option">−N</code> (<code class="option">−−newline</code>) option allows

      scan files with different newline conventions from the

      sequences they have in the input. However, the setting of
      this option does not affect the interpretation of files
      specified by the <code class="option">−f</code>,
      <code class="option">−−exclude−from</code>,
      or <code class="option">−−include−from</code> options,
      which are assumed to use the operating system's standard

      <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>
      writes informational messages to the standard error and
      output streams. For these it uses the string "\n" to indicate

      <h2>OPTIONS COMPATIBILITY</h2>
      <p>Many of the short and long forms of <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>'s options are the
      same as in the GNU <span class="command"><strong>grep</strong></span> program. Any long
      option of the form <code class="option">−−xxx−regexp</code> (GNU
      terminology) is also available as <code class="option">−−xxx−regex</code> (PCRE2
      terminology). However, the <code class="option">−−file−list</code>, <code class="option">−−file−offsets</code>,
      <code class="option">−−include−dir</code>,
      <code class="option">−−line−offsets</code>,
      <code class="option">−−locale</code>,
      <code class="option">−−match−limit</code>,
      <code class="option">−M</code>, <code class="option">−−multiline</code>, <code class="option">−N</code>, <code class="option">−−newline</code>, <code class="option">−−om−separator</code>,
      <code class="option">−−recursion−limit</code>,
      <code class="option">−u</code>, and <code class="option">−−utf−8</code> options are
      specific to <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>, as is the use of
      the <code class="option">−−only−matching</code> option with
      a capturing parentheses number.</p>
      <p>Although most of the common options work the same way, a
      few are different in <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>. For example, the
      <code class="option">−−include</code> option's
      argument is a glob for GNU <span class="command"><strong>grep</strong></span>, but a regular
      expression for <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>. If both the
      <code class="option">−c</code> and <code class="option">−l</code> options are given, GNU grep lists
      only file names, without counts, but <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> gives the counts
      as well.</p>

      <h2>OPTIONS WITH DATA</h2>
      <p>There are four different ways in which an option with data
      can be specified. If a short form option is used, the data
      may follow immediately, or (with one exception) in the next
      command line item. For example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 -f/some/file
 -f /some/file
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The exception is the <code class="option">−o</code>
      option, which may appear with or without data. Because of
      this, if data is present, it must follow immediately in the
      same item, for example -o3.</p>
      <p>If a long form option is used, the data may appear in the
      same command line item, separated by an equals character, or
      (with two exceptions) it may appear in the next command line
      item. For example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 --file=/some/file
 --file /some/file
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Note, however, that if you want to supply a file name
      beginning with ~ as data in a shell command, and have the
      shell expand ~ to a home directory, you must separate the
      file name from the option, because the shell does not treat ~
      specially unless it is at the start of an item.</p>
      <p>The exceptions to the above are the <code class="option">−−colour</code> (or <code class="option">−−color</code>) and <code class="option">−−only−matching</code> options,
      for which the data is optional. If one of these options does
      have data, it must be given in the first form, using an
      equals character. Otherwise <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> will assume that
      it has no data.</p>

    <div class="refsect1">
      <a id="pcre2grep-1_sect9" name="pcre2grep-1_sect9" shape="rect"> </a>
      <h2>CALLING EXTERNAL SCRIPTS</h2>
      <p>On non-Windows systems, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> has, by default,
      support for calling external programs or scripts during
      matching by making use of PCRE2's callout facility. However,
      this support can be disabled when <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> is built. You can
      find out whether your binary has support for callouts by
      running it with the <code class="option">−−help</code> option. If the support is
      not enabled, all callouts in patterns are ignored by
      <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>.</p>
      <p>A callout in a PCRE2 pattern is of the form
      (?C&lt;arg&gt;) where the argument is either a number or a
      quoted string (see the <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/pcre2callout.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">pcre2callout</span>(3)</span></a>
      documentation for details). Numbered callouts are ignored by
      <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>.
      String arguments are parsed as a list of substrings separated
      by pipe (vertical bar) characters. The first substring must
      be an executable name, with the following substrings
      specifying arguments:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
executable_name|arg1|arg2|...
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Any substring (including the executable name) may contain
      escape sequences started by a dollar character:
      $&lt;digits&gt; or ${&lt;digits&gt;} is replaced by the
      captured substring of the given decimal number, which must be
      greater than zero. If the number is greater than the number
      of capturing substrings, or if the capture is unset, the
      replacement is empty.</p>
      <p>Any other character is substituted by itself. In
      particular, $$ is replaced by a single dollar and $| is
      replaced by a pipe character. Here is an example:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
 echo -e "abcde\n12345" | pcre2grep \
   '(?x)(.)(..(.))
   (?C"/bin/echo|Arg1: [$1] [$2] [$3]|Arg2: $|${1}$| ($4)")()' -
</pre>
      </div>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
Output:
</pre>
      </div>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting" xml:space="preserve">
   Arg1: [a] [bcd] [d] Arg2: |a| ()
   abcde
   Arg1: [1] [234] [4] Arg2: |1| ()
   12345
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The parameters for the <code class="function">execv</code>() system call that is used to run the
      program or script are zero-terminated strings. This means
      that binary zero characters in the callout argument will
      cause premature termination of their substrings, and
      therefore should not be present. Any syntax errors in the
      string (for example, a dollar not followed by another
      character) cause the callout to be ignored. If running the
      program fails for any reason (including the non-existence of
      the executable), a local matching failure occurs and the
      matcher backtracks in the normal way.</p>

      <h2>MATCHING ERRORS</h2>
      <p>It is possible to supply a regular expression that takes a
      very long time to fail to match certain lines. Such patterns
      normally involve nested indefinite repeats, for example:
      (a+)*\d when matched against a line of a's with no final
      digit. The PCRE2 matching function has a resource limit that
      causes it to abort in these circumstances. If this happens,
      <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span>
      outputs an error message and the line that caused the problem
      to the standard error stream. If there are more than 20 such
      errors, <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> gives up.</p>
      <p>The <code class="option">−−match−limit</code> option of
      <span class="command"><strong>pcre2grep</strong></span> can
      be used to set the overall resource limit; there is a second
      option called <code class="option">−−recursion−limit</code> that sets
      a limit on the amount of memory (usually stack) that is used
      (see the discussion of these options above).</p>

      <h2>DIAGNOSTICS</h2>
      <p>Exit status is 0 if any matches were found, 1 if no
      matches were found, and 2 for syntax errors, overlong lines,
      non-existent or inaccessible files (even if matches were
      found in other files) or too many matching errors. Using the
      <code class="option">−s</code> option to suppress error
      messages about inaccessible files does not affect the return
      code.</p>
