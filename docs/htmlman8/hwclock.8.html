      <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
      <p><span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> is a
      tool for accessing the Hardware Clock. It can: display the
      Hardware Clock time; set the Hardware Clock to a specified
      time; set the Hardware Clock from the System Clock; set the
      System Clock from the Hardware Clock; compensate for Hardware
      Clock drift; correct the System Clock timescale; set the
      kernel's timezone, NTP timescale, and epoch (Alpha only);
      compare the System and Hardware Clocks; and predict future
      Hardware Clock values based on its drift rate.</p>
      <p>Since v2.26 important changes were made to the
      <code class="option">−−hctosys</code> function
      and the <code class="option">−−directisa</code>
      option, and a new option <code class="option">−−update−drift</code> was added.
      See their respective descriptions below.</p>

      <h2>FUNCTIONS</h2>
      <p>The following functions are mutually exclusive, only one
      can be given at a time. If none is given, the default is
      <code class="option">−−show</code>.</p>
      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl class="variablelist">
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−adjust</code></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Add or subtract time from the Hardware Clock to
            account for systematic drift since the last time the
            clock was set or adjusted. See the discussion below,
            under <span class="emphasis"><em>The Adjust

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−c,
          −−compare</code></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Periodically compare the Hardware Clock to the
            System Time and output the difference every 10 seconds.
            This will also print the frequency offset and tick.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−getepoch,−−setepoch</code></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>These functions are for Alpha machines only.</p>
            <p>Read and set the kernel's Hardware Clock epoch
            value. Epoch is the number of years into AD to which a
            zero year value in the Hardware Clock refers. For
            example, if you are using the convention that the year
            counter in your Hardware Clock contains the number of
            full years since 1952, then the kernel's Hardware Clock
            epoch value must be 1952.</p>
            <p>The <code class="option">−−setepoch</code> function
            requires using the <code class="option">−−epoch</code> option to specify
            the year.</p>
            <p>This epoch value is used whenever <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> reads or sets
            the Hardware Clock.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−predict</code></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Predict what the Hardware Clock will read in the
            future based upon the time given by the <code class="option">−−date</code> option and the
            information in <code class="filename">/etc/adjtime</code>. This is useful, for
            example, to account for drift when setting a Hardware
            Clock wakeup (aka alarm). See <a class="link" href="../htmlman8/rtcwake.8.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">rtcwake</span>(8)</span></a>.</p>
            <p>Do not use this function if the Hardware Clock is
            being modified by anything other than the current
            operating system's <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> command, such
            as '11 minute mode' or from dual-booting another
            OS.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−r,

      </div>
      <p>Read the Hardware Clock and print its time to standard
      output in the <span class="emphasis"><em>ISO 8601</em></span>
      format. The time shown is always in local time, even if you
      keep your Hardware Clock in UTC. See the <code class="option">−−localtime</code> option.</p>
      <p>Showing the Hardware Clock time is the default when no
      function is specified.</p>
      <p>The <code class="option">−−get</code> function
      also applies drift correction to the time read, based upon
      the information in <code class="filename">/etc/adjtime</code>. Do not use this function if
      the Hardware Clock is being modified by anything other than
      the current operating system's <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> command, such as
      '11 minute mode' or from dual-booting another OS.</p>
      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl class="variablelist">
          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−s,
          −−hctosys</code></span></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Set the System Clock from the Hardware Clock. The
            time read from the Hardware Clock is compensated to
            account for systematic drift before using it to set the
            System Clock. See the discussion below, under
            <span class="emphasis"><em>The Adjust
            Function</em></span>.</p>
            <p>The System Clock must be kept in the UTC timescale
            for date-time applications to work correctly in
            conjunction with the timezone configured for the
            system. If the Hardware Clock is kept in local time
            then the time read from it must be shifted to the UTC
            timescale before using it to set the System Clock. The
            <code class="option">−−hctosys</code>
            function does this based upon the information in the
            <code class="filename">/etc/adjtime</code> file or the
            command line arguments <code class="option">−−localtime</code> and
            <code class="option">−−utc</code>. Note: no
            daylight saving adjustment is made. See the discussion
            below, under <span class="emphasis"><em>LOCAL vs
            UTC</em></span>.</p>
            <p>The kernel also keeps a timezone value, the
            <code class="option">−−hctosys</code>
            function sets it to the timezone configured for the
            system. The system timezone is configured by the TZ
            environment variable or the <code class="filename">/etc/localtime</code> file, as <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/tzset.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">tzset</span>(3)</span></a> would
            interpret them. The obsolete tz_dsttime field of the
            kernel's timezone value is set to zero. (For details on
            what this field used to mean, see <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/gettimeofday.2.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">settimeofday</span>(2)</span></a>.)</p>
            <p>When used in a startup script, making the
            <code class="option">−−hctosys</code>
            function the first caller of <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/gettimeofday.2.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">settimeofday</span>(2)</span></a> from
            boot, it will set the NTP '11 minute mode' timescale
            via the <span class="command"><strong>persistent_clock_is_local</strong></span>
            kernel variable. If the Hardware Clock's timescale
            configuration is changed then a reboot is required to
            inform the kernel. See the discussion below, under
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Automatic Hardware Clock
            Synchronization by the Kernel</em></span>.</p>
            <p>This is a good function to use in one of the system
            startup scripts before the file systems are mounted
            read/write.</p>
            <p>This function should never be used on a running
            system. Jumping system time will cause problems, such
            as corrupted filesystem timestamps. Also, if something
            has changed the Hardware Clock, like NTP's '11 minute
            mode', then <code class="option">−−hctosys</code> will set the time
            incorrectly by including drift compensation.</p>
            <p>Drift compensation can be inhibited by setting the
            drift factor in <code class="filename">/etc/adjtime</code> to zero. This setting
            will be persistent as long as the <code class="option">−−update−drift</code> option
            is not used with <code class="option">−−systohc</code> at shutdown (or
            anywhere else). Another way to inhibit this is by using
            the <code class="option">−−noadjfile</code>
            option when calling the <code class="option">−−hctosys</code> function. A third
            method is to delete the <code class="filename">/etc/adjtime <span class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span></code>. <span class="command"><strong>Hwclock</strong></span> will then
            default to using the UTC timescale for the Hardware
            Clock. If the Hardware Clock is ticking local time it
            will need to be defined in the file. This can be done
            by calling <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
            −−localtime
            −−adjust</em></span>; when the file is not
            present this command will not actually adjust the
            Clock, but it will create the file with local time
            configured, and a drift factor of zero.</p>
            <p>A condition under which inhibiting <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>'s drift
            correction may be desired is when dual-booting multiple
            operating systems. If while this instance of Linux is
            stopped, another OS changes the Hardware Clock's value,
            then when this instance is started again the drift
            correction applied will be incorrect.</p>
            <p>For <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>'s drift
            correction to work properly it is imperative that
            nothing changes the Hardware Clock while its Linux
            instance is not running.</p>

          <dt><span class="term"><code class="option">−−set</code></span></dt>

            <p>Set the Hardware Clock to the time given by the
            <code class="option">−−date</code> option,
            and update the timestamps in <code class="filename">/etc/adjtime</code>. With the <code class="option">−−update−drift</code> option

          <dd>
            <p>This is an alternate to the <code class="option">−−hctosys</code> function that
            does not read the Hardware Clock nor set the System
            Clock; consequently there is not any drift correction.
            It is intended to be used in a startup script on
            systems with kernels above version 2.6 where you know
            the System Clock has been set from the Hardware Clock
            by the kernel during boot.</p>
            <p>It does the following things that are detailed above
            in the <code class="option">−−hctosys</code> function:</p>
            <div class="blockquote">

                      by setting the System Clock, <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>
                      simply informs the kernel and it handles the

                after boot. Consequently this option only makes
                sense when used in a startup script. If the

                then a reboot would be required to inform the

            <p>Indicate that the Hardware Clock is incapable of
            storing years outside the range 1994-1999. There is a
            problem in some BIOSes (almost all Award BIOSes made
            between 4/26/94 and 5/31/95) wherein they are unable to
            deal with years after 1999. If one attempts to set the
            year-of-century value to something less than 94 (or 95
            in some cases), the value that actually gets set is 94
            (or 95). Thus, if you have one of these machines,
            <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>
            cannot set the year after 1999 and cannot use the value
            of the clock as the true time in the normal way.</p>
            <p>To compensate for this (without your getting a BIOS
            update, which would definitely be preferable), always
            use <code class="option">−−badyear</code>
            if you have one of these machines. When <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> knows it's
            working with a brain-damaged clock, it ignores the year
            part of the Hardware Clock value and instead tries to
            guess the year based on the last calibrated date in the
            adjtime file, by assuming that date is within the past
            year. For this to work, you had better do a
            <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
            −−set</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
            −−systohc</em></span> at least once a
            year!</p>
            <p>Though <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> ignores the
            year value when it reads the Hardware Clock, it sets
            the year value when it sets the clock. It sets it to
            1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998, whichever one has the same
            position in the leap year cycle as the true year. That
            way, the Hardware Clock inserts leap days where they
            belong. Again, if you let the Hardware Clock run for
            more than a year without setting it, this scheme could
            be defeated and you could end up losing a day.</p>

            <p>You need this option if you specify the <code class="option">−−set</code> or <code class="option">−−predict</code> functions,
            otherwise it is ignored. It specifies the time to which
            to set the Hardware Clock, or the time for which to
            predict the Hardware Clock reading. The value of this
            option is used as an argument to the <a class="link" href="../htmlman1/date.1.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">date</span>(1)</span></a> program's
            \-\-date option. For example:</p>

                <p>The argument must be in local time, even if you
                keep your Hardware Clock in UTC. See the
                <code class="option">−−localtime</code>
                option. The argument must not be a relative time
                like "+5 minutes", because <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>'s

        <h3>Clocks in a Linux System</h3>
        <p>There are two types of date-time clocks:</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Hardware
        Clock:</em></span> This clock is an independent hardware
        device, with its own power domain (battery, capacitor,
        etc), that operates when the machine is powered off, or
        even unplugged.</p>
        <p>On an ISA compatible system, this clock is specified as
        part of the ISA standard. A control program can read or set
        this clock only to a whole second, but it can also detect
        the edges of the 1 second clock ticks, so the clock
        actually has virtually infinite precision.</p>
        <p>This clock is commonly called the hardware clock, the
        real time clock, the RTC, the BIOS clock, and the CMOS
        clock. Hardware Clock, in its capitalized form, was coined
        for use by <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>. The Linux kernel
        also refers to it as the persistent clock.</p>
        <p>Some non-ISA systems have a few real time clocks with
        only one of them having its own power domain. A very low
        power external I2C or SPI clock chip might be used with a
        backup battery as the hardware clock to initialize a more
        functional integrated real-time clock which is used for
        most other purposes.</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>The System Clock:</em></span>
        This clock is part of the Linux kernel and is driven by a
        timer interrupt. (On an ISA machine, the timer interrupt is
        part of the ISA standard.) It has meaning only while Linux
        is running on the machine. The System Time is the number of
        seconds since 00:00:00 January 1, 1970 UTC (or more
        succinctly, the number of seconds since 1969 UTC). The
        System Time is not an integer, though. It has virtually
        infinite precision.</p>
        <p>The System Time is the time that matters. The Hardware
        Clock's basic purpose is to keep time when Linux is not
        running so that the System Clock can be initialized from it
        at boot. Note that in DOS, for which ISA was designed, the
        Hardware Clock is the only real time clock.</p>
        <p>It is important that the System Time not have any
        discontinuities such as would happen if you used the
        <a class="link" href="../htmlman1/date.1.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">date</span>(1)</span></a> program to set it
        while the system is running. You can, however, do whatever
        you want to the Hardware Clock while the system is running,
        and the next time Linux starts up, it will do so with the
        adjusted time from the Hardware Clock. Note: currently this
        is not possible on most systems because <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock −−systohc</em></span> is
        called at shutdown.</p>
        <p>The Linux kernel's timezone is set by <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>. But don't be
        misled -- almost nobody cares what timezone the kernel
        thinks it is in. Instead, programs that care about the
        timezone (perhaps because they want to display a local time
        for you) almost always use a more traditional method of
        determining the timezone: They use the TZ environment
        variable or the <code class="filename">/etc/localtime</code> file, as explained in the
        man page for <a class="link" href="../htmlman3/tzset.3.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">tzset</span>(3)</span></a>. However, some
        programs and fringe parts of the Linux kernel such as
        filesystems use the kernel's timezone value. An example is
        the vfat filesystem. If the kernel timezone value is wrong,
        the vfat filesystem will report and set the wrong
        timestamps on files. Another example is the kernel's NTP
        '11 minute mode'. If the kernel's timezone value and/or the
        <span class="command"><strong>persistent_clock_is_local</strong></span>
        variable are wrong, then the Hardware Clock will be set
        incorrectly by '11 minute mode'. See the discussion below,
        under <span class="emphasis"><em>Automatic Hardware Clock
        Synchronization by the Kernel</em></span>.</p>
        <p><span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>
        sets the kernel's timezone to the value indicated by TZ or
        <code class="filename">/etc/localtime <span class="emphasis"><em>with the</em></span></code> <code class="option">−−hctosys</code> or <code class="option">−−systz</code> functions.</p>
        <p>The kernel's timezone value actually consists of two
        parts: 1) a field tz_minuteswest indicating how many
        minutes local time (not adjusted for DST) lags behind UTC,
        and 2) a field tz_dsttime indicating the type of Daylight
        Savings Time (DST) convention that is in effect in the
        locality at the present time. This second field is not used
        under Linux and is always zero. See also <a class="link" href="../htmlman2/gettimeofday.2.html" target="_top" shape="rect"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">settimeofday</span>(2)</span></a>.</p>

        <h3>Hardware Clock Access Methods</h3>
        <p><span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>
        uses many different ways to get and set Hardware Clock
        values. The most normal way is to do I/O to the rtc device
        special file, which is presumed to be driven by the rtc
        device driver. Also, Linux systems using the rtc framework
        with udev, are capable of supporting multiple Hardware
        Clocks. This may bring about the need to override the
        default rtc device by specifying one with the <code class="option">−−rtc</code> option.</p>
        <p>However, this method is not always available as older
        systems do not have an rtc driver. On these systems, the
        method of accessing the Hardware Clock depends on the
        system hardware.</p>
        <p>On an ISA compatible system, <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> can directly
        access the "CMOS memory" registers that constitute the
        clock, by doing I/O to Ports 0x70 and 0x71. It does this
        with actual I/O instructions and consequently can only do
        it if running with superuser effective userid. This method
        may be used by specifying the <code class="option">−−directisa</code> option.</p>
        <p>This is a really poor method of accessing the clock, for
        all the reasons that userspace programs are generally not
        supposed to do direct I/O and disable interrupts.
        <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>
        provides it for testing, troubleshooting, and because it
        may be the only method available on ISA compatible and
        Alpha systems which do not have a working rtc device
        driver.</p>
        <p>In the case of a Jensen Alpha, there is no way for
        <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> to
        execute those I/O instructions, and so it uses instead the
        <code class="filename">/dev/port</code> device special
        file, which provides almost as low-level an interface to
        the I/O subsystem.</p>
        <p>On an m68k system, <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> can access the
        clock with the console driver, via the device special file
        <code class="filename">/dev/tty1</code>.</p>

        <h3>The Adjust Function</h3>
        <p>The Hardware Clock is usually not very accurate.
        However, much of its inaccuracy is completely predictable -
        it gains or loses the same amount of time every day. This
        is called systematic drift. <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>'s <code class="option">−−adjust</code> function lets you
        apply systematic drift corrections to the Hardware
        Clock.</p>
        <p>It works like this: <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> keeps a file,
        <code class="filename">/etc/adjtime</code>, that keeps some
        historical information. This is called the adjtime
        file.</p>
        <p>Suppose you start with no adjtime file. You issue a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
        −−set</em></span> command to set the Hardware
        Clock to the true current time. <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> creates the
        adjtime file and records in it the current time as the last
        time the clock was calibrated. Five days later, the clock
        has gained 10 seconds, so you issue a <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock −−set
        −−update−drift</em></span> command to set
        it back 10 seconds. <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> updates the
        adjtime file to show the current time as the last time the
        clock was calibrated, and records 2 seconds per day as the
        systematic drift rate. 24 hours go by, and then you issue a
        <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
        −−adjust</em></span> command. <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> consults the
        adjtime file and sees that the clock gains 2 seconds per
        day when left alone and that it has been left alone for
        exactly one day. So it subtracts 2 seconds from the
        Hardware Clock. It then records the current time as the
        last time the clock was adjusted. Another 24 hours go by
        and you issue another <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
        −−adjust</em></span>. <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> does the same
        thing: subtracts 2 seconds and updates the adjtime file
        with the current time as the last time the clock was
        adjusted.</p>
        <p>When you use the <code class="option">−−update−drift</code> option
        with <code class="option">−−set</code> or
        <code class="option">−−systohc</code>, the
        systematic drift rate is (re)calculated by comparing the
        fully drift corrected current Hardware Clock time with the
        new set time, from that it derives the 24 hour drift rate
        based on the last calibrated timestamp from the adjtime
        file. This updated drift factor is then saved in
        <code class="filename">/etc/adjtime</code>.</p>
        <p>A small amount of error creeps in when the Hardware
        Clock is set, so <code class="option">−−adjust</code> refrains from making
        any adjustment that is less than 1 second. Later on, when
        you request an adjustment again, the accumulated drift will
        be more than 1 second and <code class="option">−−adjust</code> will make the
        adjustment including any fractional amount.</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
        −−hctosys</em></span> also uses the adjtime
        file data to compensate the value read from the Hardware
        Clock before using it to set the System Clock. It does not
        share the 1 second limitation of <code class="option">−−adjust</code>, and will correct
        sub-second drift values immediately. It does not change the
        Hardware Clock time nor the adjtime file. This may
        eliminate the need to use <code class="option">−−adjust</code>, unless something else
        on the system needs the Hardware Clock to be
        compensated.</p>

        <h3>The Adjtime File</h3>
        <p>While named for its historical purpose of controlling
        adjustments only, it actually contains other information
        used by <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> from one
        invocation to the next.</p>
        <p>The format of the adjtime file is, in ASCII:</p>
        <p>Line 1: Three numbers, separated by blanks: 1) the
        systematic drift rate in seconds per day, floating point
        decimal; 2) the resulting number of seconds since 1969 UTC
        of most recent adjustment or calibration, decimal integer;
        3) zero (for compatibility with <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">clock</span>(8)</span>) as a decimal
        integer.</p>
        <p>Line 2: One number: the resulting number of seconds
        since 1969 UTC of most recent calibration. Zero if there
        has been no calibration yet or it is known that any
        previous calibration is moot (for example, because the
        Hardware Clock has been found, since that calibration, not
        to contain a valid time). This is a decimal integer.</p>
        <p>Line 3: "UTC" or "LOCAL". Tells whether the Hardware
        Clock is set to Coordinated Universal Time or local time.
        You can always override this value with options on the
        <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>
        command line.</p>
        <p>You can use an adjtime file that was previously used
        with the <span class="command"><strong>clock</strong></span>(8) program with
        <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>.</p>

        <h3>Automatic Hardware Clock Synchronization by the
        Kernel</h3>
        <p>You should be aware of another way that the Hardware
        Clock is kept synchronized in some systems. The Linux
        kernel has a mode wherein it copies the System Time to the
        Hardware Clock every 11 minutes. This mode is a compile
        time option, so not all kernels will have this capability.
        This is a good mode to use when you are using something
        sophisticated like NTP to keep your System Clock
        synchronized. (NTP is a way to keep your System Time
        synchronized either to a time server somewhere on the
        network or to a radio clock hooked up to your system. See
        RFC 1305.)</p>
        <p>If the kernel is compiled with the '11 minute mode'
        option it will be active when the kernel's clock discipline
        is in a synchronized state. When in this state, bit 6 (the
        bit that is set in the mask 0x0040) of the kernel's
        <span class="command"><strong>time_status</strong></span>
        variable is unset. This value is output as the 'status'
        line of the <span class="emphasis"><em>adjtimex
        --print</em></span> or <span class="command"><strong>ntptime</strong></span> commands.</p>
        <p>It takes an outside influence, like the NTP daemon
        <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">ntpd</span>(1)</span>, to put the kernel's
        clock discipline into a synchronized state, and therefore
        turn on '11 minute mode'. It can be turned off by running
        anything that sets the System Clock the old fashioned way,
        including <span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
        −−hctosys</em></span>. However, if the NTP
        daemon is still running, it will turn '11 minute mode' back
        on again the next time it synchronizes the System
        Clock.</p>
        <p>If your system runs with '11 minute mode' on, it may
        need to use either <code class="option">−−hctosys</code> or <code class="option">−−systz</code> in a startup script,
        especially if the Hardware Clock is configured to use the
        local timescale. Unless the kernel is informed of what
        timescale the Hardware Clock is using, it may clobber it
        with the wrong one. The kernel uses UTC by default.</p>
        <p>The first userspace command to set the System Clock
        informs the kernel what timescale the Hardware Clock is
        using. This happens via the <span class="command"><strong>persistent_clock_is_local</strong></span>
        kernel variable. If <code class="option">−−hctosys</code> or <code class="option">−−systz</code> is the first, it will
        set this variable according to the adjtime file or the
        appropriate command-line argument. Note that when using
        this capability and the Hardware Clock timescale
        configuration is changed, then a reboot is required to
        notify the kernel.</p>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em>hwclock
        −−adjust</em></span> should not be used with
        NTP '11 minute mode'.</p>

        <h3>ISA Hardware Clock Century value</h3>
        <p>There is some sort of standard that defines CMOS memory
        Byte 50 on an ISA machine as an indicator of what century
        it is. <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> does not use or
        set that byte because there are some machines that don't
        define the byte that way, and it really isn't necessary
        anyway, since the year-of-century does a good job of
        implying which century it is.</p>
        <p>If you have a bona fide use for a CMOS century byte,

        <p>Whether maintaining precision time with <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">ntpd</span>(1)</span> or not, it makes
        sense to configure the system to keep reasonably good
        date-time on its own.</p>
        <p>The first step in making that happen is having a clear
        understanding of the big picture. There are two completely
        separate hardware devices running at their own speed and
        drifting away from the 'correct' time at their own rates.
        The methods and software for drift correction are different
        for each of them. However, most systems are configured to
        exchange values between these two clocks at startup and
        shutdown. Now the individual device's time keeping errors
        are transferred back and forth between each other. Attempt
        to configure drift correction for only one of them, and the
        other's drift will be overlaid upon it.</p>
        <p>This problem can be avoided when configuring drift
        correction for the System Clock by simply not shutting down
        the machine. This, plus the fact that all of <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>'s precision
        (including calculating drift factors) depends upon the
        System Clock's rate being correct, means that configuration
        of the System Clock should be done first.</p>
        <p>The System Clock drift is corrected with the
        <span class="command"><strong>adjtimex</strong></span>(8)
        command's <code class="option">−−tick</code>
        and <code class="option">−−frequency</code>
        options. These two work together: tick is the coarse
        adjustment and frequency is the fine adjustment. (For
        systems that do not have an <span class="command"><strong>adjtimex</strong></span> package,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>ntptime −f</em></span>
        <span class="command"><strong>ppm</strong></span> may be
        used instead.)</p>
        <p>Some Linux distributions attempt to automatically
        calculate the System Clock drift with <span class="command"><strong>adjtimex</strong></span>'s compare
        operation. Trying to correct one drifting clock by using
        another drifting clock as a reference is akin to a dog
        trying to catch its own tail. Success may happen
        eventually, but great effort and frustration will likely
        precede it. This automation may yield an improvement over
        no configuration, but expecting optimum results would be in
        error. A better choice for manual configuration would be
        <span class="command"><strong>adjtimex</strong></span>'s
        <span class="emphasis"><em>−−log</em></span>options.</p>
        <p>It may be more effective to simply track the System
        Clock drift with <span class="command"><strong>sntp</strong></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>date −Ins</em></span> and a precision
        timepiece, and then calculate the correction manually.</p>
        <p>After setting the tick and frequency values, continue to
        test and refine the adjustments until the System Clock
        keeps good time. See <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">adjtimex</span>(8)</span>
        for more information and the example demonstrating manual
        drift calculations.</p>
        <p>Once the System Clock is ticking smoothly, move on to
        the Hardware Clock.</p>
        <p>As a rule, cold drift will work best for most use cases.
        This should be true even for 24/7 machines whose normal
        downtime consists of a reboot. In that case the drift
        factor value makes little difference. But on the rare
        occasion that the machine is shut down for an extended
        period, then cold drift should yield better results.</p>

        <p>The Hardware Clock on an ISA compatible system keeps
        only a date and time, it has no concept of timezone nor
        daylight saving. Therefore, when <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> is told that it
        is in local time, it assumes it is in the 'correct' local
        time and makes no adjustments to the time read from it.</p>
        <p>Linux handles daylight saving time changes transparently
        only when the Hardware Clock is kept in the UTC timescale.
        Doing so is made easy for system administrators as
        <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> uses
        local time for its output and as the argument to the
        <code class="option">−−date</code> option.</p>
        <p>POSIX systems, like Linux, are designed to have the
        System Clock operate in the UTC timescale. The Hardware
        Clock's purpose is to initialize the System Clock, so also
        keeping it in UTC makes sense.</p>
        <p>Linux does, however, attempt to accommodate the Hardware
        Clock being in the local timescale. This is primarily for
        dual-booting with older versions of MS Windows. From
        Windows 7 on, the RealTimeIsUniversal registry key is
        supposed to be working properly so that its Hardware Clock
        can be kept in UTC.</p>

        'right' database the System Clock must be set to (UTC +
        leap seconds), which is equivalent to (TAI − 10).
        This allows calculating the exact number of seconds between
        two dates that cross a leap second epoch. The System Clock
        is then converted to the correct civil time, including UTC,
        by using the 'right' timezone files which subtract the leap
        seconds. Note: this configuration is considered
        experimental and is known to have issues.</p>
        <p>To configure a system to use a particular database all
        of the files located in its directory must be copied to the
        root of <code class="filename">/usr/share/zoneinfo</code>.
        Files are never used directly from the posix or 'right'
        subdirectories, e.g., TZ='<span class="command"><strong>right/Europe/Dublin</strong></span>'.
        This habit was becoming so common that the upstream
        zoneinfo project restructured the system's file tree by
        moving the posix and 'right' subdirectories out of the
        zoneinfo directory and into sibling directories:</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, some Linux distributions are changing
            it back to the old tree structure in their packages. So
            the problem of system administrators reaching into the
            'right' subdirectory persists. This causes the system
            timezone to be configured to include leap seconds while
            the zoneinfo database is still configured to exclude
            them. Then when an application such as a World Clock
            needs the South_Pole timezone file; or an email MTA, or
            <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>
            needs the UTC timezone file; they fetch it from the
            root of <code class="filename">/usr/share/zoneinfo</code> , because that is
            what they are supposed to do. Those files exclude leap
            seconds, but the System Clock now includes them,
            causing an incorrect time conversion.</p>
            <p>Attempting to mix and match files from these
            separate databases will not work, because they each
            require the System Clock to use a different timescale.
            The zoneinfo database must be configured to use either
            posix or 'right', as described above, or by assigning a
            database path to the TZDIR environment variable.</p>
